			Hey there, I'm Driftini and welcome to my website!<br><br>

			I'm an Italian guy who's got a bunch of hobbies which I like a little too much.<br><br>

			The number 29 has been haunting me throughout my life since the very moment I was born.

		<h3><p><a href="/artwork">Drawing</a></p>
</h3>
		<p><p>This is likely the one hobby dearest to me out of all the ones listed here.</p>

<p>I used to draw characters from old cartoons back in around 2018-19, then gradually started building my own artstyle starting from 2020 and began drawing characters from Touhou and whatnot in the same year. Around 2022, I started making digital art way more often as well. Right now, I’m finding my bearings in digital painting to work on backgrounds for my high-effort art faster and better.</p>

		<h3><p><a href="https://last.fm/user/driftini">Music</a></p>
</h3>
		<p><p>Definitely a huge part of my life as well, I listen to all kinds of stuff during most of the day.</p>

<p>Timeframes for music I like weirdly change depending on the genre: for Japanese music it’s nearly all 2016-17 onwards, for pop, rock, hip-hop and other more “mainstream” genres it’s usually 2014-15 or older (going as far back as the 90s except for a couple albums). Other genres I like are Eurobeat, instrumental/ambience and some game soundtracks.</p>

<p>Now, for some artists I really like roughly ordered by music genre:</p>

<p><strong>Non-japanese music with lyrics</strong>: Green Day, Jamiroquai, Cyne, Finger Eleven, Bop Alloy, Michael Jackson, Ne-Yo.</p>

<p><strong>J-pop/j-rock/vocaloid</strong>: Inabakumori, Zutomayo, Yama, Tsukuyomi, Yorushika, Reol, Ado.</p>

<p><strong>Eurobeat</strong>: Ken Blast/Odyssey/Mortimer (…), Ace, Manuel, Leslie Parrish.</p>

<p><strong>Ambience/instrumental</strong>: Nujabes, Chris Christodoulou, Boards of Canada.</p>

		<h3><p>Gaming</p>
</h3>
		<p><p>Shouldn’t come as a surprise. I’m a huge fan of character action/<em>hack and slash</em> games to the likes of <em>Devil May Cry</em>, roguelikes such as <em>Dead Cells</em> and <em>Risk of Rain 1 &amp; 2</em>, but from time to time, I also play (modded) Doom and other FPSes.</p>

<p>I used to be an enormous <em>Metroid</em> fan as well, but after years of near-total radio silence on the franchise in the past, my interest for it has kind of died out.</p>

<p>All I’ve been playing lately though is <em>Yume 2kki</em>. Exploration and finding cool worlds there is just really addicting, not to mention said cool worlds tie really well with my interest in art.</p>

<p>Special mention here to <em>Katana ZERO</em>. I <strong>very</strong> strongly recommend playing it, because of the plot that really pulled me in, amazing soundtrack, snappy and fun gameplay and really cool visuals.</p>

		<h3><p>Tech</p>
</h3>
		<p><p>If it’s related in any way to technology, I probably like it. What I do not like though, is who just can’t help but brag about their choice of Linux distro to use, <strong>especially</strong> if the latter is Arch.</p>

<p>With that said, I <em>do</em> admittedly dualboot Windows and Arch, but rather than bragging rights, my reason to use this distribution is mostly the enormous amount of packages the AUR offer. That, and to have a blank canvas to build a fancy setup upon.</p>

<p>I also spend a lot of time on web - but on and off, also on game - development, the former of the two blending really well with my next interest in this list.</p>

	<div class="aboutParagraph">
		<h3><p>Design</p>
</h3>
		<p><p>You might’ve guessed it from this website’s visual direction - I enjoy designing and coding graphical interfaces making use of old UI design tropes like skeuomorphism, what I like to call “1px details”, compact layouts and so on.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I’m also a big fan of a few particularly great modern themes such as KDE’s Breeze and, to a lesser extent, Numix and Wine’s new light theme.</p>

		<h3><p><a href="/wallpapers">Photography</a></p>
</h3>
		<p><p>I have kinda dropped this hobby over the last few years, but if I ever find myself outdoors and around a pretty scenery, I am going to take a couple pictures of it, more likely than not.
The few pictures I take that I deem good enough make it to my desktop as wallpapers.</p>
