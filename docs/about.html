			Hey there, I'm Driftini and welcome to my website!<br><br>

			I'm an Italian guy who's got a bunch of hobbies which I like a little too much.<br><br>

			The number 29 has been haunting me throughout my life since the very moment I was born.

	<h2>My interests</h2>

	

	<div class="interestParagraph">
		<h3><p><a href="/artwork">Drawing</a></p>
</h3>
		<p><p>This is likely the one hobby dearest to me out of all the ones listed here.</p>

<p>I used to draw characters from old cartoons back in around 2018-19, then gradually started building my own artstyle starting from 2020 and began drawing characters from Touhou and whatnot in the same year. Right now I am mostly experimenting with different character designs, poses and perspective, while also getting more acquainted to digital art.</p>
</p>

	<div class="interestParagraph">
		<h3><p>Music</p>
</h3>
		<p><p>Definitely a huge part of my life as well, I listen to all kinds of stuff during most of the day.</p>

<p>I mainly enjoy “old” (2015 or older) mainstream music, Nujabes tracks (I particularly love the <em>Luv(sic.) Hexalogy</em>), Eurobeat and amazing game soundtracks such as <em>Devil May Cry 5</em>, <em>Guilty Gear Strive</em> and <em>Metal Gear Rising: Revengenance</em>’s to name a few.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve mentioned Eurobeat is among my favorite kinds of music, I’ll also take advantage of the moment to say that some of my favorite artists from this genre are Odyssey, Manuel and ACE.</p>
</p>

	<div class="interestParagraph">
		<h3><p>Gaming</p>
</h3>
		<p><p>Shouldn’t come as a surprise. I’m a huge fan of character action/<em>hack and slash</em> games to the likes of <em>Devil May Cry</em>, roguelikes such as <em>Dead Cells</em> and <em>Risk of Rain 1 &amp; 2</em>, but from time to time, I also play fancy Doom mods (<strong>not</strong> <em>Brutal Doom</em>) and some open-world games like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild</em>.</p>

<p>I used to be an enormous <em>Metroid</em> fan as well, but with the recent somewhat dead state of the franchise, my interest for it has kind of died out.</p>

<p>The best game I’ve ever played is very likely <em>Katana ZERO</em>. I <strong>very</strong> strongly recommend playing it, more than anything else I’ve mentioned before.</p>
</p>

	<div class="interestParagraph">
		<h3><p>Tech</p>
</h3>
		<p><p>If it’s related in any way to technology, I probably like it. What I do not like though, is who just can’t help but brag about their choice of Linux distro to use, <strong>especially</strong> if the latter is Arch.</p>

<p>With that said, I <em>do</em> admittedly dualboot Windows and Arch, but rather than bragging rights, my reason to use this distribution is mostly the enormous amount of packages the AUR offer. That, and to have a blank canvas to build a fancy setup upon.</p>

<p>I also spend a lot of time on web - and recently game - development, the former of the two blending really well with my next interest in this list.</p>
</p>
	</div>

	

	<div class="interestParagraph">
		<h3><p>Design</p>
</h3>
		<p><p>You might’ve guessed it from this website’s visual direction - I enjoy designing and coding graphical interfaces making use of the good old skeuomorphism we were <em>so</em> used to back in the days of Windows 7 and similar.</p>
</p>
	</div>

	

	<div class="interestParagraph">
		<h3><p>Photography</p>
</h3>
		<p><p>I have kinda dropped this hobby with the arrival of the ongoing pandemic, but if I ever find myself outdoors and around a cool scenery, more likely than not I am going to take a couple pictures of it.
The few pictures I take that I deem good enough make it to my desktop as wallpapers.</p>
