			Hey there, I'm Driftini and welcome to my website!<br><br>

			I'm an Italian guy who's got a bunch of hobbies which I like a little too much.<br><br>

			The number 29 has been haunting me throughout my life since the very moment I was born.

		<h3><p><a href="/artwork">Drawing</a></p>
</h3>
		<p><p>This is likely the one hobby dearest to me out of all the ones listed here.</p>

<p>I used to draw characters from old cartoons back in around 2018-19, then gradually started building my own artstyle starting from 2020 and began drawing characters from Touhou and whatnot in the same year. Right now I am mostly experimenting with different character designs, poses and perspective, while also getting more acquainted to digital art.</p>

		<h3><p><a href="https://last.fm/user/driftini">Music</a></p>
</h3>
		<p><p>Definitely a huge part of my life as well, I listen to all kinds of stuff during most of the day.</p>

<p>I mainly enjoy “old” (2015 or older) mainstream music and hip-hop, of which my favorite artists are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO5XcuQe_fLJVI3sZ0LmGCA">Nujabes</a> (I particularly love his and Shing02’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_ljDzjEYTId7ii1JmD_s741NUv3oiL2iGs"><em>Luv(sic.) Hexalogy</em></a>) and A Tribe Called Quest.</p>

<p>I also listen to Eurobeat and amazing game soundtracks such as <em>Devil May Cry 5</em>, <em>Guilty Gear Strive</em> and <em>Metal Gear Rising: Revengenance</em>’s to name a few.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve mentioned Eurobeat is among my favorite genres, I’ll also take advantage of the moment to say that some of my favorite Eurobeat artists are <a href="https://odysseymusic.bandcamp.com/">Odyssey</a>, Manuel and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGpmhTM8wAknIC_rncL97Pw">ACE</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve also recently gotten into J-Pop, which I had never thought I would’ve liked so much. My favorite artists in the genre are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/inabakumori">Inabakumori</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcd-GOvl9DdyPVHQxy58bOw">Zutomayo</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4lk0Ob-F3ptOQUUq8s0pzQ">Sangatsu no Phantasia</a>.</p>

<p>Another genre I have discovered recently is dreampop, by listening to <a href="https://megumiacorda.bandcamp.com/">Megumi Acorda</a>’s amazing album <a href="https://megumiacorda.bandcamp.com/album/unexpectedly"><em>unexpectedly</em></a> thanks to a friend’s recommendation. I really recommend checking out their music, although a lot of it is not on their Bandcamp and generally pretty hard to find.</p>

		<h3><p>Gaming</p>
</h3>
		<p><p>Shouldn’t come as a surprise. I’m a huge fan of character action/<em>hack and slash</em> games to the likes of <em>Devil May Cry</em>, roguelikes such as <em>Dead Cells</em> and <em>Risk of Rain 1 &amp; 2</em>, but from time to time, I also play fancy Doom mods (<strong>not</strong> <em>Brutal Doom</em>) and some open-world games like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild</em>.</p>

<p>I used to be an enormous <em>Metroid</em> fan as well, but with the recent somewhat dead state of the franchise, my interest for it has kind of died out.</p>

<p>The best game I’ve ever played is very likely <em>Katana ZERO</em>. I <strong>very</strong> strongly recommend playing it, more than anything else I’ve mentioned before.</p>

		<h3><p>Tech</p>
</h3>
		<p><p>If it’s related in any way to technology, I probably like it. What I do not like though, is who just can’t help but brag about their choice of Linux distro to use, <strong>especially</strong> if the latter is Arch.</p>

<p>With that said, I <em>do</em> admittedly dualboot Windows and Arch, but rather than bragging rights, my reason to use this distribution is mostly the enormous amount of packages the AUR offer. That, and to have a blank canvas to build a fancy setup upon.</p>

<p>I also spend a lot of time on web - and recently game - development, the former of the two blending really well with my next interest in this list.</p>

	<div class="aboutParagraph">
		<h3><p>Design</p>
</h3>
		<p><p>You might’ve guessed it from this website’s visual direction - I enjoy designing and coding graphical interfaces making use of the good old skeuomorphism we were <em>so</em> used to back in the days of Windows 7 and similar.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I’m also a big fan of a few particularly great modern themes such as KDE’s Breeze and, to a lesser extent, Numix and Wine’s new light theme.</p>

		<h3><p><a href="/wallpapers">Photography</a></p>
</h3>
		<p><p>I have kinda dropped this hobby with the arrival of the COVID pandemic, but if I ever find myself outdoors and around a cool scenery, more likely than not I am going to take a couple pictures of it.
The few pictures I take that I deem good enough make it to my desktop as wallpapers.</p>
