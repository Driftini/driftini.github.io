<p>Yes, this is the actual first Robotboy drawing I made this year. Not counting sketches of course, they looked just too bad to be uploaded here.</p>

<p>Anyway, the body Ro has in this drawing doesn’t look right to me… any tips to fix that in my next drawings?</p>

<p>Also, as you can see I’ve changed Robotboy’s color scheme quite a bit, giving him more light colors and a bit less dark blue.
I’ve also added some shading here - not enough to make the drawing look bad though - and it makes the drawing look better, so I guess I’ll add shading to my next uploads as well.</p>

<p>One last thing, to draw that weapon thing in Ro’s right arm I took inspiration from Booster’s Clutch Gatling.</p>

<p>Booster is character from a Doom mod made by TerminusEst13. Said mod is still in development, but there’s a nice tech demo you can try already. Just look for it and sooner or later you’ll find it.</p>

<p>With this said, I leave you without my drawings until… tomorrow maybe? See you!</p>

<p>Nice big textwall of a description here, huh?</p>

<p>If those sketches looked “bad” according to early-2019 me, I am <strong>seriously</strong> afraid of ever digging them up again from my art album.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That is not shading. Just a gradient with too much contrast applied to a few cylinders.
And no, it does <em>not</em> make the drawing any better.</p>
