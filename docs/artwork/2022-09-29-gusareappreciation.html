	<p>By far the biggest, most complex drawing I’ve made so far.
Saying I’m crazy proud of it would be an understatement.</p>

<p>This is kind of a token of my immense appreciation for <a href="">Zutomayo’s album <em>Gusare</em></a>, and especially <a href=""><em>Hunch Gray</em></a>, one of the absolute bangers featured in it.</p>

<p>In fact, the background is actually designed after the city depicted in <em>Hunch Gray</em>’s music video, and the car facing away from the “camera” is the one Nira (the main character in ZTMY’s MVs) has got in the aforementioned video.</p>

<p>That car has given me quite a few headaches for weeks, I had never drawn a car in such detail (and in perspective) before now.
It doesn’t help that I decided to put it at an angle that is neither of the &lt;10 different illustrations of the car in the referenced MV.</p>

<p>As for Nira herself, I settled for her <a href=""><em>Study Me</em></a> design, rather than the <em>Hunch Gray</em> one, seeing as how it’s kind of the most iconic one.</p>

<p>I’ve worked on this for about.. 2 months, starting from the first concept sketches?
Definitely could’ve taken way less time, or at least it could have if I had proper digital drawing equipment instead of, you know, a phone and a cheap aluminum stick with a cloth tip from Amazon.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, here I’ve put into practice many things I’ve recently learned, such as perspective and half-decent anatomy.
It’s also my first experience with coloring a massive background and adding just enough detail to not make it look plain.</p>

<p>I’ve definitely missed a few details such as the clearly visible moss scattered across the buildings’ walls in the <em>Hunch Gray</em> MV, but I guess the other slight details I’ve added partly make up for that.</p>

<p>I’d like to thank everyone who has helped me with the making of this - <em>for my standards</em> - behemoth of a drawing, particularly <a href="https://twitter.com/atlaszoidac/">atlaszoidac</a>, who has given me some <strong>incredibly</strong> valuable help with making the car look right!
If it weren’t for him, that car would’ve looked about 2 meters longer than it does in the final drawing.</p>
