	<p>I saw some dude at my school wearing a bunch of… pretty weird clothes? Thought it would’ve been fitting to quickly make up a character design <strong>at the very least</strong> as ridiculous as - and based on - his outfit. Please don’t mind how absurdly messy this is, I didn’t really take this sketch seriously.</p>

<p>So, here we have a sword with chaingun barrels (this one could’ve admittedly been much better), a tie-shaped knife in place of a regular tie, a literal twin scythe scarf, a waist clock held in place by a skull (not that clear in the actual drawing) and a top hat which I genuinely considered making into a nuclear warhead.</p>

<p>Oh, and let’s not forget how this fine gentleman is smoking gunpowder from a sniper round. I’ll probably repurpose some of the stuff here for more… <em>normal</em> character designs.</p>
