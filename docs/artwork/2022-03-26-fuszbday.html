	<p>While at school, I got a notification showing it was <a href="https://twitter.com/fusazakura_">Fusazakura</a>’s birthday.
Quick context - they’re one of my favorite artists and a few details in my artstyle were inspired by their artwork.
Anyway, I thought their birthday would’ve been a good excuse to draw their OC and try drawing “hair vents” (no, I have no idea if this is their actual name) for the first time.</p>

<p>Just like with <a href="/artwork/2022-03-20-aikoyori">the Aikoyori drawing</a>, I made <a href="/artwork/2022-03-26-fszmisc">a few sketches of Fusazakura’s OC</a> at school and started working on the fully fleshed out drawing at home.</p>

<p>I definitely got spoiled during <a href="/blog/2022-03-15-wacomfxp1">my time with my friend’s Wacom One</a> - drawing on my phone after all this time revealed to be kind of a torture. Out of nowhere, I had to fight again against Sketchbook overly smoothening my brush strokes, latency and everything else.</p>

<p>Getting the sketch finished took me way more than expected, with the final lineart and color doubling down on that.</p>

<p>Speaking of the color, I think it really saved this drawing: I believe the lineart turned out to be… <em>pretty bad, actually.</em>
<em>Also</em> speaking of the color, I still have to figure out a decent way to draw the eyes’ scleras. On the Aikoyori drawing I kind of got away with something pretty simple, but not so much here.</p>

<p>Overall, the whole drawing was relatively rushed, took me 4 hours of would’ve-been sleep <em>and</em> has a bunch of mistakes and oversights regarding both the lineart and coloring.
In the end though, Fusazakura liked it so I guess it isn’t a total trainwreck.</p>

<p><em>I should probably invest in a drawing tablet as soon as possible and start making actually good stuff.</em></p>
