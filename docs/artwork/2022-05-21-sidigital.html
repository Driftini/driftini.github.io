	<p>I may have not bought that Wacom yet, but I ended up getting back to digital drawing anyway.
Just like a few months ago, I’m using my phone.
The difference this time is the app I’m using: Ibis Paint X, which I’ve found to be better over Autodesk Sketchbook in a few ways.</p>

<p>For starters, Ibis <em>feels</em> so much better to use than Sketchbook.
I don’t really know how to explain it, but the brush dynamics probably play a role in this.
It’s also way more feature-rich, with an insane amount of available filters and more.</p>

<p>Not all that shines is gold, though - Ibis has ads.
They don’t exactly ruin the experience and (usually) don’t annoy me while I’m in the middle of drawing, but their presence still particularly annoys me.
There is also a ton of content locked behind a paywall, which, coming from an app completely devoid of any, I find <strong>very</strong> annoying.</p>

<p>Thankfully, none of that locked content is that interesting to me, nor I believe it could help me with anything.</p>

<p>Whatever, enough app comparison talk.
Let’s get to the drawing itself.</p>

<hr />

<p>Pose-wise, this is as flat as it gets.
I am getting too used to drawing characters like that.</p>

<p>I think the flat shading looks pretty nice, though.</p>

<p><em>Could this be the beginning of another digital “phase”?</em></p>
