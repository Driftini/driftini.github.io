<p>Oh man, finally got to this one. Like it or not, totally interesting lore time.</p>

<p>I mostly use Twitter to browse cool people’s equally cool artwork, but I am extremely annoyed by how so many good artists out there can’t help but post more or less (with an <strong>enormous</strong> gap in that “or”) questionable content, or just straight up NSFW (not even marked as such).</p>

<p>I (not so) recently found <a href="https://twitter.com/atlaszoidac">Atlas’s account</a> on Twitter and have been really happy to see he practically never posts the kind of content I wouldn’t want to see when checking my timeline in public.</p>

<p>Besides, I believe his art is really cool and he’s pretty much my favorite online artist as of writing this post.</p>

<p>With the <em>very touching</em> and <em>absolutely important</em> backstory cleared up: on Christmas, he had made a tweet asking to make any drawing, I wanted to do something fancy, and <a href="https://twitter.com/somehowsieg">my friend Sieg</a> over on Discord suggested me to draw his OC, so that’s what I did! And had a blast doing, too.</p>

<p>I streamed the whole drawing process to my friends’ group chat, getting real-time feedback and just having a ton of fun. As for the end result? I’m really glad with how it turned out, although I think the sketch looked… somewhat cleaner? Also, the left arm and pockets look sorta weird to me. Even then, I did manage to get the design pretty much right in just three tries which is pretty unusual of me.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I believe this drawing practically saved an otherwise extremely subpar Christmas (I’ve been ill and in lockdown for the entire holidays). Also, I strongly recommend following or at least checking out <a href="https://twitter.com/atlaszoidac">Atlas’s Twitter account</a>, he makes some seriously great stuff.</p>
