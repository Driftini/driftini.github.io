	<p>First and foremost, some quick context: <em>Snacked for a Hundred Yume</em> or <em>SHY</em> is a “project” of sorts that I’m starting to routinely practice backgrounds and poses alike.
It’s pretty simple: I draw the location of every Vending Machine Finder expedition on <a href="https://ynoproject.net/2kki">Yume Nikki Online</a>, which refreshes about every 3 days.
With that said, let’s get to my thoughts on the first entry for this project: today’s vending machine is in the <a href="https://yume.wiki/2kki/Greenhouse"><em>Greenhouse</em></a>.</p>

<p>To start off on a negative note… I have finished this 2 days late.
By now, I should’ve been working on the drawing of the vending machine in <a href="https://yume.wiki/2kki/Decrepit_Dwellings"><em>Decrepit Dwellings</em></a> by now… but I really, REALLY underestimated how much time I was going to take to finish this entry.</p>

<p>Besides lack of practice, what made me lose an ungodly amount of time here was usage of background layers so bad it’d give anyone with no more than 7 days of experience in digital painting a brain aneurysm.
Long story short, making big changes in the whole lower half of the background would’ve taken about thrice the normal amount of time - this is why I haven’t populated the space beyond the barrier.</p>

<p>The same issue pretty much forced me to - with great pain - leave alone the left side of the barrier/fence, even after quickly realizing just how wrong its proportions were, compared to its right half.
In hindsight, I should’ve tried drawing the barrier’s diamond pattern front-facing first, then using the perspective tool to place it correctly, perhaps during the sketch process.
I’ve seen god-tier artists use the perspective tool for backgrounds before, so I guess using it like this would be socially acceptable.</p>

<p>Now we arrive at the stuff closest to the “camera” - which I thankfully believe fares <em>much</em> better compared to what I’ve talked about until now.
I’m fairly happy with how Urotsuki looks here, especially considering I haven’t sketched her nearly as much as I usually do with other characters I make high-effort drawings of.</p>

<p>I guess the vending machine looks fine enough, although it does lack a ton of detail as soon as you move your eyes from its top to the lower half.
The fancy shines are probably what saves it… I wonder if I’ve gone a little overboard with them?</p>

<p>Before I wrap this up, I wanted to mention a couple extra things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>For the first time, I tried to use some very slight post-processing to improve the contrast of the final picture.</li>
  <li>The canvas for this drawing was originally much larger than what’s shown here. 
I had to heavily cut it down to save time, but also becuase there wouldn’t have been much to fill the extra space anyway.</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s about it for this drawing - now if you’ll excuse me, I have to get moving to get my snack at <em>Decrepit Dwellings</em> before the Vending Machine Finder expedition refreshes again.</p>
