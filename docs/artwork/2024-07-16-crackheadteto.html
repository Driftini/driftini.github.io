	<p>Truly my magnum opus.</p>

<p>The idea was born from a conversation with friends about a cracked copy of SynthV and its Teto voicebank, and I was quick to realize this could’ve been great inspiration for a drawing.</p>

<p>I used a stock picture as loose reference, and it seems to have paid off very well!
It didn’t take long for me to lay down a workable sketch, and from there, things kept going pretty smoothly.</p>

<p>Clearly, I must’ve felt pretty optimistic about this drawing from the very beginning, seeing as how I thought about featuring two characters I had never drawn before: Miku and Rei.
Surprisingly, that didn’t go wrong!</p>

<p>One immediately obvious omission here is shading: I was afraid it would’ve extended the total drawing time by far too long, so I just skipped it entirely (except for the glass table).
Regardless, I didn’t shy away from experimenting with new stuff either: I tried using “particle effects” to give the characters and scene more life, something I believe was a good call.</p>

<p>This drawing is proving to be very educational, too!
Until now, I thought crack and cocaine were interchangeable names for the same thing, but as it turns out I was completely wrong, <a href="https://wetdry.world/@driftini/112809246822983554">as a quick Wikipedia visit proved to me</a>, with unexpectedly funny implications on a drawing that is already a shitpost to begin with.</p>

<p>Last but not least, this drawing is making me seriously consider implementing some kind of content warning system in FumoNet V3.
Someday…</p>
