	<p>I still can’t believe it, but I guess I’m doing light animation now.</p>

<p>Here goes another iconic shot from Jujutsu Kaisen’s <em>Hidden Inventory</em> arc - this took me a good while to make, between newfound lack of time and my little experience with animation!
Granted, this is definitely not <em>animation</em> animation, but it ain’t a still image either.</p>

<p>To be completely honest, I <em>have</em> done some proper animation too… but you’re gonna have to wait to see that.</p>

<p>I expected the baguette’s moving shadow to be enough to not make this feel too static, and it kinda does the job, but in hindsight I believe I should’ve drawn a couple more frames for the hair to make it flow ever so slightly.
Or maybe some very slight movement on the background?</p>

<p>Anyhow, fun fact: I crashed Krita at least 5 or 6 times while working on this, thanks to my utter abuse of its filter masks.
That’s right, I finally discovered the feature that will open the floodgates to absolute eyecandy abuse from my part.</p>

<p>Here’s some context: in the (not so far) past, I used to apply filters “destructively”, that is by permanently changing the original layer.
That made tweaking those filters quite tedious, not to mention it forced me to keep copies of what was effectively the same layer, just with or without a filter applied.</p>

<p>With filter masks, all that tedium is gone.
I can just take any layer, throw a filter mask on it and come back anytime to tweak the filter or do whatever with it.
All that freedom comes at a cost, though: having tons of filter masks can really slow down Krita (and I don’t blame the developers for that), ESPECIALLY in animations.
Pretty quickly, I got to the point where the animation preview just failed to play smoothly enough, and I resorted to disabling all effects.
That is, unless I wanted to render a more accurate preview of what the animation would’ve looked like with all the eyecandy enabled.</p>

<p>Another new thing I’ve done here is, believe it or not, actually coloring Teto’s eyes!
A defining feature of the reference scene here was obviously Gojo’s overdetailed eyes, and I couldn’t just skip that while parodying it.
I’m not <em>exceedingly</em> happy with the result here, but it’s undeniably far better than just black ellipses with white dots (which admittedly work very well on uncolored lineart).</p>

<p>That’s about all I have to say about this one, here’s to hoping this is the beginning of another ridiculous streak of great drawings to wrap up this year!</p>
