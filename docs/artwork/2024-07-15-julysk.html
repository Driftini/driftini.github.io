	<p>Unlike the past “[month] sketches” posts, all drawings here were made in one night and I just didn’t have a better idea of how to frame them for a post here.</p>

<p>I kicked off things with <a href="/artwork/2024-07-10-headachet3">yet another redraw</a> of a scene from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jneo_p9h6WI">Headache MV</a>.
I’m not as satisfied with this as my last attempt - this doesn’t feel nearly as dramatic, and overall just… very plain.</p>

<p>I followed that up with a doodle of <a href="https://misskey.io/notes/9vgx9r3vahim052a">Developing’s OC</a>.
Now that I think about it, I should’ve probably gone a step further and color it, but knowing myself I would’ve probably not stopped there and continued with shading and all.
Similarly to the <a href="/artwork/2024-07-01-grumpyuro">Urotsuki drawing from a while ago</a>, I originally made her head a bit too wide at first.
And just like last time, I ended up noticing by mirroring the canvas and fixed things up by mostly just moving around things until it looked right again.</p>

<p>But the real star of this batch is the third and last drawing of <a href="https://lethallava.land/@vl1">my friend vl1</a>’s OC.
It’s been by far the most fun and challenging drawing of these 3, thanks to the pose and perspective - which didn’t come out great, but still better than none at all.</p>

<p>Fun fact: I didn’t make these in MS Paint as the last couple drawings!
I quickly put together an aliased brush in Krita with minimal pressure and speed sensitivity, so that I could keep working with a type of brush I’m already very comfortable with, while also being able to use layers and other advanced things at the same time.</p>
