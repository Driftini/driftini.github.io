	<p>I had bookmarked <a href="https://wetdry.world/@hmr__i@misskey.io/112095099100846211">a sketch by Himari</a> (which is unnecessarily marked as NSFW for some reason) some time ago for later analysis, since it has appeal while lacking color, shading and other distractions.</p>

<p>That ended up being my reference for this doodle… that turned out shockingly good??
It really makes me look far more skilled than I really am.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, now I shifted from wanting to study Himari’s drawing to wanting to study my own.
After all, now it’s pretty clear artstyle isn’t where that appeal was coming from.</p>

<p>My wild guesses at what makes this doodle work so well are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clean-ish lineart that doesn’t lack in weight variation;</li>
  <li>Good proportions;</li>
  <li>The eyes have a slight “depth” effect, by sinking the iris a bit into the head and slightly covering it by the eyelash (best demonstrated here by Teto’s left eye);</li>
  <li>The mouth being broken up in a long line and a smaller dot (something you might see a lot in anime and illustrations by more skilled artists);</li>
  <li>Pose… more like “camera” angle;</li>
  <li>The head shape has some kind of very good balance of slimness, roundness and slight sharpness;</li>
  <li>Direct eye contact.</li>
  <li>The eyes “pop” a lot by being the brighest features in the drawing, together with a couple other highlights, which probably also play a role in making the drawing feel very “balanced”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, I can only hope I’ll crack the secret behind this doodle soon enough so I can begin consistently drawing like this without waiting for a few more years of experience!</p>
