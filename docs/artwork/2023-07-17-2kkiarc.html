	<p>Ahhh, how long has it been since I got into my Zutomayo arc?
Looks like almost an exact year.
Sure, I did have a Yama arc, but that wasn’t really as meaningful art-wise.
Anyway, all of this to say that it seems like I’ve just begun my new long arc that’ll have a big impact on my artwork. Ladies, gentlemen and anything in-between (or not), brace yourselves: my <a href="https://yume.wiki/2kki/Yume_2kki_Wiki#About_Yume_2kki">Yume 2kki</a> arc.</p>

<p><em>Quick context: Yume 2kki is a <a href="https://yume.wiki/yume/Yume_Nikki">Yume Nikki</a> fangame.
Both games involve exploring dream worlds ranging from total nonsense to the coolest places you could think of.</em></p>

<p>I’ve only started playing a few days ago, but I’m already in love with the game.
I had heard about it in the past, but didn’t know much until very recently.
I happened to stumble on a YouTube video of someone’s journey to a world in 2kki called Rainy Apartments, and one particular world in the route struck me: Windswept Scarlet Sands - it was love at first sight.
Eager to visit the place myself, I decided to start playing 2kki on the <a href="https://ynoproject.net/">YNOproject website</a>.
But before that, I thought that it would’ve been a cool idea to play Yume Nikki as well: the game has been piqueing my interest for years now, what better moment to check it out?
Anyway, after a couple days of intense dreaming in Madotsuki’s shoes I finished Yume Nikki and saw a good portion of its content along the way.
And finally, the time to get into 2kki had come– oh damn, I really lost track of the main topic here. Putting the story of how I got into 2kki aside (for a future blog post!)…</p>

<p>To kick off this new arc, here are my very first 3 sketches of Urotsuki, Yume 2kki’s protagonist.
You’ll be seeing her a lot on my website for the next few months, I’m afraid.</p>

<p>The 3rd one looks really off, the blank expression and plain standing pose are just… boring.
I think the other two sketches are cool, even though they’re not really in my usual style.
Potential changes to my artstyle incoming?</p>
