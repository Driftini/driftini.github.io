	<p>Don’t get me wrong, unambitiously <a href="/artwork/2024-09-21-istrokemybaguette">redrawing shitpost edits of manga panels</a> is great and all, but making the second, surprisingly great experimental drawing in the past couple months?
Yeah, I think that sounds quite better.</p>

<p>Following the trend of the past couple drawings, I’m using reference more heavily than usual (and I’m still using Jujutsu Kaisen brainrot as fuel).</p>

<p>This was kind of a daunting shot to draw, the “dynamic” feel of the original frame from the Jujutsu Kaisen anime was pretty scary to think about in particular.</p>

<p>Regardless, I somehow managed to not let overthinking get the best of me and I took on this little challenge.</p>

<p>There isn’t much to say about the lineart here, besides Teto’s twin drills being way too large even for my style, and Amanai-Rei looking quite good thanks to some well-placed deviation from reference, where I’ve gone for a more exaggerated face expression.
Oh, and I also allowed some highlights to “bleed into” the lineart, which actually looks pretty nice on Teto’s hand.</p>

<p>My shading/lighting process here was influenced by <a href="https://twitter.com/eletenshi">Eleakuma</a>’s art, which I’ve been exposed to somewhere along the making of this drawing.
You can make it out a little on the smooth hand lighting, and on Teto’s shirt.</p>

<p>It’s weird to think I would’ve originally gone for a single shading and lighting color per “material” weren’t it for that influence, it would’ve definitely dragged this drawing down a couple notches.</p>

<p>The background was tricky, and even though I’ve put quite some effort into it, it’s easy to see I haven’t dedicated as much care to it as to the characters.
I tried to take some shortcuts for its making, such as duplicating the general shape of all the debris, scaling it down and cleaning up the lines to give it a 3D look without wasting too much time on it - I believe that was a good call, considering the drawing was already taking a bit longer to finish than I had expected.</p>

<p>Fast-forward a bit, and I had pretty much everything done.
Characters, background, shading… but that vague dynamic feel of the original scene was still missing.
That’s when I copied the near-finished drawing on GIMP to (MANUALLY) apply chromatic aberration, and that actually made quite a subtle, yet strong difference.</p>

<p>I mean, it really had better not been a waste of time, cause I swear that process was seriously a chore to do manually.
Honestly, I’m kinda surprised chromatic aberration isn’t a built-in filter in Krita.
Maybe I missed something somewhere?</p>

<p>In the midst of all the other stuff, I also ended up kinda forgetting about composition, and I had to crop off quite a large chunk of the canvas, which is why this drawing probably feels “cramped” in some way.</p>

<p>Anyway, wrapping up: result?
Good, I’m happy with it!</p>

<p>I ended the last art post saying things go in alternating highs and lows, but… you know, I wouldn’t mind staying up high for a little longer, instead of dipping low again after a good drawing.
As long as breaking that balance doesn’t backfire…</p>
