	<p>Behold, the second entry of <em>SHY</em> - the project where I use YNO’s Vending Machine Finder expeditions as an excuse to practice painting!
Today’s featured location is <a href="https://yume.wiki/2kki/Sky_Kingdom">Sky Kingdom</a>.
Please do ignore how this should’ve come out about two weeks ago.</p>

<p>Straight from the first glance, it should be obvious there are some major differences between the making of <a href="/artwork/2023-08-12-shy01"><em>SHY01</em></a> and this.
Unlike <em>01</em>, the focus here has been shifted even further towards the background, rather than Urotsuki.</p>

<p>Speaking of the background, this time I’ve completely done away with the overly slow process I used in <em>SHY01</em>: instead of using layers for different background elements, I… used none.
Not like I had any choice, using MS Paint for this drawing (painting?).
Also, I haven’t wasted time trying to make perfectly accurate shapes - and failing at the hands of a fence with a diamond pattern - which allowed me to save enough time to finish the background in about 2 hours and 30 minutes, with nearly all the work done within the first hour and 50 minutes.</p>

<p>At this point, you might be wondering why I took so long to get this finished.
The answer is procrastination: I held off from drawing Urotsuki and wrapping this up for over a week.
In the end, this might’ve been for the better, though!
Not too long ago I tried <a href="/artwork/2023-08-27-urostylish">pouring some more style in an Uro sketch</a>, which resulted in something far better than any other drawing of her that I had made at the time.
I tried to do the same thing here, although at a much smaller scale.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, <em>SHY03</em>’s background is nearly complete… and there are 4 more <em>SHY</em> entries queued up.
This is really starting to get messy.</p>
