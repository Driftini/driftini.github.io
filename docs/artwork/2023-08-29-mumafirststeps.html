	<p>My friend <a href="https://lethallava.land/@t">Theki</a> got me to play the RPGmaker game <a href="https://yume.wiki/muma/Muma_Rope_Wiki">Muma Rope</a> with him on <a href="https://ynoproject.net/muma">Yume Nikki Online</a>.
Its first large area, <a href="https://yume.wiki/muma/First_Steps">First Steps</a>, really surprised me thanks to its awesome contrast between dark gray rocks and neon-green grass.
So I decided to paint it for practice.</p>

<p>Going from memory, making this took me about 2 hours…?
Which would be fine if I hadn’t worked on this at 1AM, ending up going to sleep real late.
This last detail contributes to my unsatisfaction with this painting: when I paint from reference, my main goal is capturing the reference’s mood/atmosphere.
And I don’t think I’ve done a great job at it here.</p>

<p>First of all, the grass in the game’s location has a noise pattern for bright yellow-ish spots, which I had no idea how to replicate.
The solution I decided upon was painting a few splashes of a yellower shade of the grass’ green.
In hindsight, I should’ve scaled down my reference screenshot and used the prevalent shade of green/yellow that the grass had <em>there</em>.</p>

<p>Other than that, I went too light with the amount of flowers dotting the place: the game features way more of them.
I think the rocks look pretty good, probably the moss I added at their bottom helped to make the grass-to-rock transition feel more natural.
That said, I should’ve made their edges look sharper.</p>

<p>The fence at the cliff’s edge looks fine enough, although having more of the cliff itself show might’ve been nicer.
To wrap up the painting analysis, I intentionally skipped proper shading since it is not there in-game, and I thought it would’ve ruined the looks… but on second thought, it would’ve probably helped a lot to make this not feel as “off” as it does.</p>

<p>Now, a few words about Muma Rope itself.
While I didn’t have any solid expectations for the game, I would’ve never thought this game would’ve struck me so hard with some of its locations and overall difference from Yume Nikki and 2kki.
The worlds’ artwork is pretty consistently high-quality and I love how nearly every world has its own gimmick, be it gameplay-related or just in the visuals.
If you’re into Yume Nikki or its fangames, you should definitely check this out!</p>
