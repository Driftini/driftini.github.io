	<p>As anticipated by <a href="/artwork/2023-08-12-shy01"><em>SHY 01</em></a>, I have decided to get started in digital painting, for the sake of cutting down time spent working on backgrounds of my high-effort works while still getting good-looking results.
This is - as very stealthily hinted at by the title - my first attempt at painting something loosely based off a random Terragen render I made last year.</p>

<p>Even though I lack any experience with this kind of art… this came out looking surprisingly great?
Not to mention it only took me 20 minutes to get a really good-looking WIP.
I frankly don’t know whether to be impressed by myself or to downplay this whole work because I used a reference.</p>

<p>Regardless, I hope the painting journey I’m beginning right now will lead to some pretty stuff in not too long.</p>
