	<p>I evidently hadn’t had enough of drawing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugpywe34_30"><em>Hunch Gray</em></a> Nira just yet.</p>

<p>Quick disclaimer - this isn’t finished at all.
I’ve redrawn the whole thing on a larger canvas, but I kinda gave up on it in the middle of coloring.
The only reason I picked this earlier sketch over the newer version is because I feel like the incomplete coloring of the latter might be too distracting.
And I also believe the chunkier look of the strokes on the smaller canvas used by this sketch is cooler.</p>

<p>Nira herself looks fairly good, except for the shoes.
They don’t look nearly as bulky as they are in the MV.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the background is still obviously in its rough sketch state: the more keen-eyed among you may have noticed how Nira has one too, although the opacity of that one is a little lower.</p>

<p>In fact, I originally wanted this to be a wallpaper (hence the attempt to redraw this on a larger canvas I mentioned earlier), since I was getting tired of using <a href="/artwork/2022-09-29-gusareappreciation">the Gusare one I made a while back</a>.</p>
