	<p>One of my first drawings made on a drawing tablet, <a href="/blog/2022-03-15-wacomfxp1">more on that here</a>.
I am incredibly happy with how this one turned out. Drawing tablets really do pull off miracles, don’t they?</p>

<p>Alright, miracles aside - I couldn’t have wished for more accuracy to the reference material, plus I have made this on my second day ever of using a drawing tablet!
I don’t know, I just… expected it to take much longer to get used to.</p>

<p>I haven’t gone overboard with reference (like I often do), and I believe that really helped making this into a nice drawing. I’ve also noticed how, unlike with digital drawing on my phone and 3DS, I have <em>not</em> made shapes wider than they’re supposed to.</p>

<p>I do think the bottle looks a bit too small, I am still not that used to foreshortening.
Also, I clearly wasn’t aware of the fineliner brush for text.
Another thing that looks off to me is how I colored the <em>totally-not-blood</em> - I should’ve probably made the bigger chunk darker and the top brighter… even though I’m not so sure how that would turn out, I’m not really familiar with drawing liquids.
Looking back, I also believe that the torso is a bit too short and that the pocket should’ve been larger since well, it’s not empty.
Oh well, definitely not gonna go back and fix the lineart now.</p>

<p>On the brighter side, this is <strong>by far</strong> my best and most accurate attempt at drawing Atlas in weeks of practice. Again, I’m so damn proud of this. Especially when comparing the final outcome to that godawful first sketch. They literally look like they were made by different people!</p>

<p>I am starting to think I should just delay that big, cool drawing I’ve mentioned a few times already to when I get a drawing tablet of my own, it’d just be way better than doing the whole thing on my phone.
As I’ve said in <a href="blog/2022-03-18-wacomfxp3">the 3rd entry of my Wacom One first impressions journal</a>, brush strokes here just feel way richer and more dynamic than anything I could ever do with Sketchbook on my phone.</p>

<hr />

<p>As mentioned in the drawing itself: <strong>the cool guy here belongs to <a href="https://twitter.com/atlaszoidac">atlaszoidac</a>!</strong> As I said in the page for <a href="/artwork/2021-12-25-atlasxmas">the first Atlas drawing I’ve made</a>, you should absolutely check out his own works.</p>

<p>Anyway, <em>why do the good drawings always have to be random shitposts?</em> No, like really - every drawing I actually plan out <strong>always</strong> turns out to be worse than on-the-moment stuff.</p>
