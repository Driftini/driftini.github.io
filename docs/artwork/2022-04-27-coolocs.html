	<p>Decided to redraw pretty much every character I’ve drawn since… January 2021 or so? In other words, not only recent OCs (mine and not), but also a few Touhou characters that I’ve drawn on more than one occurrence.</p>

<p>I’ve worked on this over the course of a few days, and that time definitely paid off great in the end: I am <strong>very</strong> happy with how this one came out.</p>

<p>Going more in detail, I believe <a href="https://twitter.com/fusazakura_">Fusazakura</a>’s OC looks so much better here than in <a href="/artwork/2022-03-26-fuszbday">the drawing I spent an entire night working on</a>.</p>

<p>As far as <a href="https://twitter.com/atlaszoidac">Atlas</a> goes, I got his boxhead to look cleaner than how it usually is in my drawings.
The hair and pretty much everything looks just as clean, I believe.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Aikoyori">Aikoyori</a> is probably among the few I messed up in some way - I don’t know, she just looks… off to me?
And I have the feeling the face expression is the main cause.</p>

<p>Not much to say about the Skill Issue guy, although the scythe is not exactly accurate to how it’s supposed to look.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ceroblitz">Ceroro</a>’s Cardiegon is another one I believe I messed up.
This time, I don’t think the issue is the face expression as much as, maybe, the positioning of the head?
Unlike with Aikoyori, I honestly can’t really pinpoint what went wrong here.</p>

<p>As for the Touhou characters, I think they all came out pretty nicely, although Marisa’s head is a bit off.</p>
