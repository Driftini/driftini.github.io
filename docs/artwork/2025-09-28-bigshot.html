	<p>No, not that one.
Not until I check out Deltarune, at least.</p>

<p>If you haven’t been keeping up with my yapping <a href="">on Fedi</a> (which is likely), you might’ve missed that I’ve been watching <em>Puella Magi Madoka Magica</em> for the past week.
Turns out I’m actually really liking it thus far (I finished episode 10 just earlier), so it’s only natural I was gonna make some drawings of it.</p>

<p>That bit of context aside, this one wasn’t even meant to be colored at first, rather just a quick warmup sketch.
But I spent way longer than I expected on the lineart, so I ended up quickly coloring it and blocking out the vaguest resemblance of a “background” to make the whole thing presentable enough for a post of its own.</p>

<p>Since I finished this fairly late at night, I didn’t have time to give it the usual eyecandy treatment I used for <a href="/artwork/2024-10-01-bassdrop">several</a> of my <a href="/artwork/2024-10-24-hpearple">best drawings</a> last year.
That might’ve been a mistake, as I feel like the end result here really lacks the impact you’d expect from a goofy, huge rifle like that.</p>

<p>Putting aside the somewhat salty feelings from leaving the drawing unfinished to some extent, I still think this is pretty nice at its core.
Oh, and this was also my very first time drawing Mami - I hadn’t even made a single sketch of her before this!
For being a first time, I think I didn’t do that bad of a job at getting her outfit right.</p>

<p>Before closing this post, let me also ruin your future (re)watches of <em>Madoka Magica</em>’s early episodes by pointing out that Shaft seems to have forgotten to draw Mami’s gloves in a shocking amount of shots!
Granted, not that I noticed until I started looking more closely into the scenes for reference - it’s not so glaring you’ll notice on a normal watch.</p>
