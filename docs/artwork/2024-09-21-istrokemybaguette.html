	<p>Hot off the success of <a href="/artwork/2024-09-19-malevolentbakery">Malevolent Bakery</a>, I felt like making more JJK brainrot-fueled art was the right way to go.</p>

<p>This time I slouched on ambition, merely planning to redraw a couple edited panels from the manga in my own style. And, like, with vocal synths, because it’s funny or something.</p>

<p>My original expectations for this drawing weren’t to be trusted: I thought I’d breeze through drawing Gojo-Teto, and have a hard time with Toji-Kaito.</p>

<p>But nope!
It was completely the other way around.
For some reason, I struggled really hard to draw Teto, probably because the reference was just way too far from my style and I failed to translate it well enough.</p>

<p>As for Kaito, getting a male head to look decent wasn’t as hard as I expected with my very rusty skills in that regard.
I made my life a little easier on top of that by not referencing the Jujutsu Kaisen manga, but the same scene from the anime adaptation, with a much cleaner style, for better or for worse.
Well, easily for the better from the point of view of someone trying to reference its scenes.</p>

<p>Anyway, the end result is that Kaito’s face winded up looking a lot more convincing than Teto’s.</p>

<p>Generally, this is an obvious step down from Malevolent Bakery, but I guess things just gotta have highs and lows.
And guess what comes after lows?</p>
