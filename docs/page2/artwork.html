<p>
  As you may have guessed from <a href="/about.html">my about page</a>, drawing is one of my main hobbies.<br>
  This page contains the vast majority of the stuff I've drawn so far.<br>
  Why? Well, it's both for myself, to see how I'm improving over the years, and for other people to have a single page
  containing all of my artwork.<br><br>

  Why not use something like DeviantArt, Pixiv and the likes? No idea, really. I guess making my own art archive is
  more fun.<br>
  Besides, I am not a massive fan of those websites' userbases, so not having to directly interact with them is an
  added bonus.<br><br>

				<h2>First attempt at digital painting</h2>
				<p> As anticipated by SHY 01, I have decided to get started in digital painting, for the sake of cutting down time spent working on backgrounds of my high-effort works while still getting good-looking results.
This is - as very stealthily hinted at by the title - my first attempt at painting something loosely based off a random Terragen render I made last year.

				<h2>Snacked for a Hundred Yume @ Greenhouse</h2>
				<p> First and foremost, some quick context: Snacked for a Hundred Yume or SHY is a “project” of sorts that I’m starting to routinely practice backgrounds and poses alike.
It’s pretty simple: I draw the location of every Vending Machine Finder expedition on Yume Nikki Online, which refreshes about every 3 days.
With that said, let’s get to my thoughts on the first entry for this project: today’s vending machine is in the Greenhouse.

				<h2>Yama digital sketch</h2>
				<p> I think this one looks pretty cool, kind of a shame I dropped it so early.
Then again, I had no real ideas to expand it (besides coloring), so I guess keeping it simple might’ve been a good call.

				<h2>Heading into my dreamer arc</h2>
				<p> Ahhh, how long has it been since I got into my Zutomayo arc?
Looks like almost an exact year.
Sure, I did have a Yama arc, but that wasn’t really as meaningful art-wise.
Anyway, all of this to say that it seems like I’ve just begun my new long arc that’ll have a big impact on my artwork. Ladies, gentlemen and anything in-between (or not), brace yourselves: my Yume 2kki arc.

				<h2>Bop Alloy/Yama crossover wallpaper</h2>
				<p> It’s been a long while since the last wallpaper I’ve drawn: during all this time, I moved on to a somewhat more consistent artstyle and my skills have improved.
Not to mention, I’m not restricted to a tiny phone screen anymore, since now I have a proper drawing tablet.
So, I decided to make a new background to flex with on as many devices as I could.
Okay, fine– AND also to get a sliver of attention from my favorite singer.
