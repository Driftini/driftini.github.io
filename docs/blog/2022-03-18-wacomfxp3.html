	<p>Two for the price of one!
Yesterday I barely drew anything and was too tired to prepare the blogpost, so I decided to merge it with the 4th day’s - so today’s - journal entry.</p>

<p><em>This is the third entry in my <strong>Wacom One first impressions</strong> journal. <a href="/blog/2022-03-15-wacomfxp1">You can read the first post here</a>.</em></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="day-3">Day 3</h2>
<p>I started drawing later than usual, at around 8PM. I decided to bring some variety to my art by drawing <a href="https://twitter.com/Aikoyori">my friend Aikoyori</a>’s OC, who I had only ever <a href="/artwork/2022-03-19-miscaiko">sketched a couple times</a> that same day’s morning: I thought it would’ve served as a nice sort of exercise to get more used to adapting characters to my own artstyle and bring even more variety in the long run.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/blog/2022-03-18-wacomfxp3_1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Meanwhile, I was in a voice chat with some friends and as the topic turned into Among Us for a while, I took a break from the Aiko drawing to make a quick shitpost.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/blog/2022-03-18-wacomfxp3_2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once I was done with that one, I hopped back to the Aikoyori drawing and started working on the final lineart… only to get too tired to keep working on it less than a hour later, planning to continue work on it on the next day.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/blog/2022-03-18-wacomfxp3_3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Nothing else really came out of that day, and I went to sleep sad to the thought of having almost completely wasted a day before returning my friend’s Wacom One back to him.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="day-4">Day 4</h2>
<p>This morning I woke up determined to make as much use as possible out of the drawing tablet as soon as I got back home from school, before returning it to my friend tomorrow… <em>much unlike yesterday</em>.</p>

<p>Plot twist, turns out he’s alright with me keeping his tablet for even more time.
If this isn’t what you’d call a saint, I don’t know who else would be.
To not make things too unfair, I’ll only extend the time until Monday, with this Sunday being the last day I get to spend with the One.</p>

<p>This isn’t changing my plans, though: I <strong>still</strong> do want to spend as much of today as possible drawing stuff.</p>

<p>I start getting to work at around 4:20PM, although I take it all a bit too slowly and end up not really finishing anything today either.</p>

<p>Anyway, the first sketch I make today is supposed to be the thumbnail for this post, but I don’t really finish in the end.
Being the idiot I am, I also spill some tea on my hoodie while trying to reproduce the pose I was drawing in real life and… attempting to somehow use it as reference?</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/blog/2022-03-18-wacomfxp3_4.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Next up, I come back to the Aiko sketch from yesterday… and wipe the lineart I made until now.
Why? I want to slightly change her clothing on Aikoyori’s - the actual person this time - advice, but I also end up touching up her hair and making the bangs on the side longer and more accurate to my reference pictures.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/blog/2022-03-18-wacomfxp3_5.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After a couple hours (it took this long mostly just because I was talking around on Discord instead of actually focusing on drawing) I finish the new lineart.
I believe erasing the old lineart wasn’t so bad of an idea, since I feel like the hair came out much better in the current one.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/blog/2022-03-18-wacomfxp3_6.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The drawing is still not really finished, since I plan to color it and add some extra details. I’ll probably do that tomorrow. Probably.</p>

<hr />

<p>Sorry for posting this so late, but I’m pretty damn bad at time management.
Still happy with the sketches’ quality and I keep forgetting I’ve been using a drawing tablet for less than a week.</p>

<p>I think the biggest difference between drawing on my phone and using the Wacom One is how… dynamic the brush strokes feel?</p>

<p>This is probably unrelated to pressure detection, although that one is incredibly convenient as well, especially when making rough sketches.
I feel like the massive difference in screen size and being able to see the whole drawing at once makes an <strong>enormous</strong> difference as well.</p>

<p>This post wraps up this small blog series. I could write about my 5th and 6th days with the Wacom, but they were pretty uneventful, so I just ended up deciding to omit them.</p>
