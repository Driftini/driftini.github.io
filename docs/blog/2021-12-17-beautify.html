	<p>Man, it’s nearly been <em>a full year</em>, but the wait (for me, at least) is finally over – the blog is back! And with a much better implementation, I have to say!</p>

<p>Finally, I can write blog posts in Markdown instead of having to use special HTML tags, <strong>especially</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;br&gt;</code>. Summed up to the other advantages the transition to Jekyll is bringing, I can feel this will make my life a <em>lot</em> easier in the long run.</p>

<p>I can already imagine being able to painlessly write blog posts on a somewhat regular basis, on a much easier to maintain website… but not a bunch of people actually reading this stuff. I don’t think that’s ever gonna happen.</p>

<p>In fact, nobody can even read this the day I’m writing it! The website is still offline and far from finished, but I guess this could be fun to read again in the future… <em>maybe…?</em></p>

<hr />

<p>So… what’s actually in store for this website as of writing this post?
For starters, I’m planning to implement <strong>dedicated pages for my art, wallpapers</strong> (and pictures in general, really) <strong>and projects.</strong></p>

<p>No work at all has been done on those, but I assume it shouldn’t take long, since I can just use Jekyll’s collections system to separate blog posts from drawings, etc.</p>

<p>On top of that, the design of the website is still pretty rough and could benefit from some more time spent polishing it.</p>

<hr />

<p>What I am working on right now (aside from pretty much the whole website) is “beautifying” last year’s ancient blog posts to improve their readability in the new website. I haven’t carried over the pictures yet, but I’ll do that in the next couple days, unless any problems come up.</p>

<p>At any rate, readers from the future, I guess that’s it for this post. I hope you’re liking my website so far!</p>
