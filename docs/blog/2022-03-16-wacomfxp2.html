	<p>This morning has been a little more productive than yesterday’s - I made a few quick sketches at school, just to make sure this wouldn’t have been another of those annoying days where I appear to have forgotten how to draw.
When I came back home, I haven’t immediately picked up the drawing tablet as planned, and have only begun making stuff around the late afternoon, just like yesterday.</p>

<p><em>This is the second entry in my <strong>Wacom One first impressions</strong> journal. <a href="/blog/2022-03-15-wacomfxp1">You can read the first post here</a>.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>To start things off nice and easy, I’ve made a quick sketch as kind of a warmup. Nothing too insane, yet.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/blog/2022-03-16-wacomfxp2_1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Next up, I’ve decided to pick up again a bad sketch from yesterday night, aiming to just tweak it just enough to make it look decent.
A few minutes later, here I am, making a new sketch from scratch and slowly beginning to make this into a higher effort drawing.</p>

<p>It has taken me about an hour to get <em>very</em> close to finishing up the lineart, plus a little over another hour to clean things up and add a grand total of… two colors. <em>Considering gray as a color, that is.</em></p>

<p>The end result is currently my most accurate Atlas sketch to <a href="https://twitter.com/atlaszoidac">atlaszoidac</a>’s own artwork. I am <em>really</em> proud of this. By the way, you can <a href="/artwork/2022-03-16-amongsoda">read more of my thoughts on this drawing here</a>.</p>

<p>So far so good, huh? I can’t believe this is just my second day of using a drawing tablet - guess my friends were right when they said having one can pull off miracles. I am starting to think buying a Wacom One myself would be far from a bad idea, considering the unexpectedly short amount of time I needed to get used to the one I borrowed from my friend.</p>

<p>I’m just so happy with this that I don’t want to go to sleep and just keep drawing stuff, but I guess I <em>do</em> - sadly - need some sleep, after all. Well, I can’t wait for tomorrow. See you then, with <a href="/blog/2022-03-18-wacomfxp3">the 3rd entry of this journal</a>!</p>
