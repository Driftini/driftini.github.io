	<p>It’s been quite a while since last post, so I thought it’d be nice to post a general update.</p>

<p>As it turns out, this summer is gonna be quite different from the past ones: I have broken out of the old habit of not drawing anything during this season.
In other words, I can benefit from 2-3 more months worth of practice this year and speed up the (already relatively fast) recent improvements I’ve noticed in my work.
I also feel like the quality of my recent works is starting to get pretty consistent, which brings me some extra confidence.</p>

<p>I am finally leaving my comfort zone comprised of mostly head shots, and venturing into full body drawings including proper backgrounds.
I think this sketch I’ve been working on for a couple nights now is the perfect example of that (well, it’s what I was referring to after all).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/blog/2022-07-05-summernews.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I regret not having properly practiced drawing backgrounds until now, but I guess late is better than never.</p>

<p>Overall, I have the strong feeling that the remainder of this year and the next year are gonna be pretty wild, art-wise - I am <em>really</em> excited.</p>

<p>Considering the pace at which I’m improving, I am giving some thought about beginning to take commissions around this autumn, so to get more drawing ideas, bring in more variety, improve, and obviously make a little profit from something I am passionate about.</p>

<hr />

<p>Moving onto a different topic, I wanna talk a bit about my newfound passion for j-pop.</p>

<p>It all started by coming across <em><a href="https://youtu.be/sSYoz0JmnZo">Electric Angel</a></em> in an old stream on <a href="https://twitch.tv/atlaszoidac">atlaszoidac’s Twitch channel</a>, probably around January or December.
I particularly liked the song, so I looked it up on YouTube to listen to it a couple more times.</p>

<p>A week or so later, I get back on YouTube only to see a handful of meme videos about some “Lagtrain” thing, which I soon find out to be <a href="https://youtu.be/UnIhRpIT7nc">a song</a> and give it a listen.</p>

<p>I do like the song and grab a bunch of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/inabakumori">Inabakumori</a> (the artist) albums from Soulseek - I quickly start loving some tracks in particular, like the aforementioned <em>Lagtrain</em>, but also the single <em><a href="https://youtu.be/G5hScSFkib4">Rainy Boots</a></em> and some tracks from the 2019 album <em>Anticyclone</em>, such as <em><a href="https://youtu.be/cYClxH2WY8E">Pascal Beats</a></em> and <em><a href="https://youtu.be/ETHu8dz4f_Y">Cooler Girl</a></em>.</p>

<p>So, here my expectations of Vocaloid, a genre I have never really liked (and still don’t, outside of Inabakumori’s music and <em>Electric Angel</em>), had already been subverted.</p>

<p>But the real bombshell wouldn’t drop until <a href="https://twitter.com/Aikoyori">my friend Aikoyori</a> began introducing me to a few j-pop artists such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4lk0Ob-F3ptOQUUq8s0pzQ">Sangatsu no Phantasia</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcd-GOvl9DdyPVHQxy58bOw">Zutomayo</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/EXSpins">Tuyu</a>.</p>

<p>I got pretty much brainwashed immediately and got hooked to Sangatsu no Phantasia’s music at first, listening to all their albums first (and falling in love with <em><a href="https://youtu.be/O8tP2_wKSjM">Bitter Sweet</a></em> in particular), then the two recent singles <em><a href="https://youtu.be/iN0dC5_JQ4U">Ivy Dance</a></em> and <em><a href="https://youtu.be/5JrlSDQreTY">Shikaku Unmei</a></em> (real banger).</p>

<p>As for Zutomayo, I don’t remember what album I started with, but I do remember the first song I’ve listened coming from them was <em><a href="https://youtu.be/Sfz5TpCRSiI">Neko Reset</a></em>. 
A few days ago, I’ve decided to relisten to their albums and grew quite the addiction to <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kZnXbea4f7XrKfUq1Ibwa11JrqFa7BfJU">Gusare from 2021</a>, of which I love <em><a href="https://youtu.be/258qUAI7rck">Can’t Be Right</a></em> and <em><a href="https://youtu.be/ugpywe34_30">Hunch Gray</a></em>, among a few other tracks.
As far as singles go, I find <em><a href="https://youtu.be/BVvvUGP0MFw">Mirror Tune</a></em> to be really damn great, although it took me a few listens to realize how much I liked the song.</p>

<p>I have listened to a couple albums of Tuyu’s, plus the new single <em><a href="https://youtu.be/cp8UEv8i0lc">Would be nice if you grow up one day</a></em>.
I do really like the latter, together with a couple songs from the their 2020 album: particularly <em><a href="https://youtu.be/LoK17z6xDwI">Under the summer breeze</a></em>.</p>

<p>I am still having trouble moving away from these last four artists as I can’t really find anyone else I really like, guess I’ll need some advice on that.</p>

<hr />

<p>Unrelated to the rest, I’ll also get my driving license in a few days from now and I’ve started thinking about going to some tech/art/whatever conventions or events on my own sometime, just to spend some time having fun while bringing along a friend or two and possibly getting to know some cool people whom I share interests with.</p>

<p>Well, here we are at the end of this post.
Long one, huh?
I just felt like sharing some news, but this quickly turned into massive textwall, <em>especially</em> with the j-pop section.
See you on the next post, I guess.</p>
