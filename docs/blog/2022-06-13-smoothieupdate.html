	<p>About two months of work, finally coming to a close.
Meet the new FumoNet.</p>

<p>As it turns out, this website’s old stylesheets were a massive pain to work with and expand.
So, I restarted from scratch with a new approach: a main stylesheet containing a ton of variables and SCSS mixins for UI components, and a separate stylesheet specifically made for FumoNet.</p>

<p>I decided to do things this way to make porting the theme elsewhere a much easier job, and also to make future updates easily applicable to every port without having to hunt for dozens of different classes, each with their own tweaks.</p>

<p>Enough about the internals, though.
What does all this translate to on my website?
Well, a pretty massive visual makeover.</p>

<p>The homepage’s layout is still pretty similar to the old one, although properly animated now and showing a manually selected art post, instead of the latest one like before.</p>

<p>What did change quite a bit is the Blog, Wallpapers and Artwork index pages: instead of a bunch of floating massive cards, now everything is contained in a compact box with the thumbnail (if any), some of the post’s body and the date.</p>

<p>The pagination pill has also been replaced by a row of buttons below the posts.</p>

<p>Though, I believe one of the biggest improvements in this update lies in the post details page for the Artwork and Wallpaper archives.</p>

<p>Now attachments don’t waste an stupidly enormous amount of screen space anymore, making posts with tons of pictures look way cleaner.</p>

<p>Oh, and attachments can be hovered on to expand them.
In other words, the index pages now focus on showing as much content as possible in a clean-ish way, while the details pages finally focus on the actual pictures.</p>

<p>I believe there are still many rough edges in this update (the elephant in the room being the lack of a mobile stylesheet for now), but I will clean them up as time goes on… hopefully.</p>
