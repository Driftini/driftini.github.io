	<p>I have been wanting to take a picture of some berries for a while now, and I came across a few during a walk.
After snapping a RAW photo and coming back home, I spent some time messing around with it (mostly its saturation) in Snapseed and this was the result.</p>

<p>As of writing this, this photo is also the desktop wallpaper of my current XFCE setup.</p>
