            <h1>Rewrite in progress</h1>
            <p>The Froggy Shrine is currently undergoing a complete rewrite to achieve goals including, but not limited to:
                <ul>
                    <li>(Finally) being mobile-friendly.</li>
                    <li>Less hardcoding.</li>
                    <li>Optimization of the News/Blog section.</li>
                    <li>A new overall appearance.</li>
                </ul>
                Want to visit the old site? No problem! The link is in the navbar at the top of the page. Just keep in mind that because of the rewrite, some things might not work as they should.
            </p>
            <h1>Wallpapers page fixes</h1>
            <p>I have fixed an oversight in <a>the wallpapers page</a> that prevented the download of FHD wallpapers.
                <br>Now you should be able to install HD and FHD wallpapers alike.
                <br>As a little extra, I have changed how the page works on mobile devices for a better experience across different platforms.
