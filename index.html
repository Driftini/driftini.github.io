            <h1>Rewrite in progress</h1>
            <p>The Froggy Shrine is currently undergoing a complete rewrite to achieve goals including, but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>(Finally) being mobile-friendly.</li>
                <li>Less hardcoding.</li>
                <li>Optimization of the News/Blog section.</li>
                <li>A new overall appearance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Want to visit <a href="OLD/index.html">the old site</a>? It's still there, just keep in mind that because of the rewrite, some things might not work as they should.</p>
            <h1>Wallpapers page fixes</h1>
            <p>I have fixed an oversight in <a>the wallpapers page</a> that prevented the download of FHD wallpapers.
                <br>Now you should be able to install HD and FHD wallpapers alike.
                <br>As a little extra, I have changed how the page works on mobile devices for a better experience across different platforms.
