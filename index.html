        <p>THE FROGGY SHRINE is currently under a radical reworking to achieve these goals:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>(Finally) be mobile-friendly;</li>
            <li>Less hardcoding;</li>
            <li>An easier to work with, faster and prettier News page, which will be also renamed to Blog;</li>
            <li>A new overall appearance;</li>
            <li>And more...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Want to visit the old site? No problem! Just keep in mind that because of the updates currently going on, some things might not work as they should.</p>
