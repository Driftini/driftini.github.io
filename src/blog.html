<h1>Blog Posts</h1>
<p>
  <!-- Here you can find a complete index of my blog.<br>
  The topics I talk about in each post could be just about anything: photography, technology, drawing... you name it.<br><br>

  The boxes below contain a short excerpt of their respective posts and a thumbnail where available - you can click on them to read the full posts.<br><br>
  -->
  Here you can find all of my blog posts.
  The topics I talk about vary wildly depending on the post,
  but now you can quickly figure out each one's through the new tag system.<br><br>

  I hope you have as much fun reading them as I did writing them!
