I have been wanting to take a picture of some berries for a while now, and I came across a few during a walk.
After snapping a RAW photo and coming back home, I spent some time messing around with it (mostly its saturation) in Snapseed and this was the result.

As of writing this, this photo is also the desktop wallpaper of my current XFCE setup.
