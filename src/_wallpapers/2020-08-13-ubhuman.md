As a big fan of Ubuntu 6.06 and finding myself in the middle of working on a [Windows93 theme exactly inspired by the former](https://github.com/Driftini/93Tweaks/tree/master/themes/sapiens), I had the idea of trying my hand at vectorizing the old *Simple Human* wallpaper that shipped with the Ubuntu release in question.

It didn't take too long, and the result ended up being really nice and surprisingly accurate to the source material.

Obviously, I finally set this as the wallpaper for the aforementioned Windows93 theme.
