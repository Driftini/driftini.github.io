title: 'Headache redraw attempt #3'
---
My third attempt at redrawing one of the last shots from [the music video of *Headache* by Eipu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jneo_p9h6WI).

I really liked the original shot in the MV ever since my first watch, so I thought about trying to redraw it every so often to get better at more subtle details in face expressions.
Speaking of which - as it turns out, expressions aren't only made up by facial features!
You'd be surprised at how big of a difference the three sweatdrops on Teto's face make here.

I brought some slight perspective into the mix to freshen things up and not make this a straight up trace of my reference, and I think it helps to make the drawing more "dramatic".

I'm not uploading my previous attempts, you'll just have to believe me when I say they're really bad.
