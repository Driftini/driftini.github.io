The title pretty much explains itself. It's just been quite a while since I've drawn the Skill Issue guy, so I thought it'd be nice to make a quick sketch of him.

I feel like it turned out pretty nice: the lineart is clean (unlike the sketch), the anatomy looks good for the most part and I haven't really made many mistakes.
His left arm looks pretty weird though, as it doesn't really look like it's bending...?

The clothing dynamics are, as usual, pretty random.
I haven't bothered giving the guy a face since I didn't really have much room for detail - *the whole head is barely wider than a single centimeter.*
