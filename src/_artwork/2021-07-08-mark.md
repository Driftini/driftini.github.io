This stuff is getting recent, I wouldn't consider these descriptions to be retrospectives anymore.

With this said, Mark is probably the first original character I've ever posted online, and one of the first I have made to begin with.

The gun he has on the left is able to cast programmable spells (will likely add more depth to that, else it'd just be a complete Mahouka ripoff) from reusable "bullets" that define which spell gets casted when firing the gun.

I am thinking about a complete redesign for Mark, since I'm using most of the design elements shown here for the Skill Issue main character. Plus, I want a more interesting design that isn't as generic (same thing applies to the Skill Issue guy).

Speaking of Skill Issue, Mark will likely appear in it, one way or the other, at some point in the game. *Perhaps even as a playable character?*

Reminder there are **zero guarantees** of the above ever happening, more often than not I have to shelf some ideas because they're overambitious.
