I don't think I've ever been hypnotized so badly by a song on my FIRST day of listening to it until now.

A while back I bookmarked a post by a fellow artist on Fedi ([go check them out](https://misskey.io/@woohoocat), they're awesome) sharing [*Fumble!* by Fujiwara Hagane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsRtQ9pocQg), and when I finally checked the song out, I found myself looping it several times and headbanging within a hour or two.
Then I followed it up by some 20-30 more loops once it pumped me up enough to get drawing.

I may have been a bit over my head, thinking to put hands and perspective in the same drawing, but surprisingly that didn't turn out to be a mistake.
Well, the perspective isn't that great, but not distractingly bad either.

I'm proud of the shading here, especially on the red accents on the clothing's shoulders.
It just looks... very right in a way I can't really describe, it's weird.

I had to follow up [the original post](https://wetdry.world/@driftini/112544282067836651) with a couple of quick revisions to fix a rogue patch of color where it shouldn't have been and to make some corrections to the japanese characters on the right (for which I have to thank my friend [Aikoyori](https://www.twitter.com/Aikoyori), I would've totally missed the misspellings weren't it for him).
