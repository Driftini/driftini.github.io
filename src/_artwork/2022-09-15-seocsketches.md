title: September-October doodles

A whole bunch of random sketches I've made between, as the title *very subtly* implies, during September and October, punctually beginning from the first day of school.

Here you can spot some more advanced posing practice, attempts at sideways bodies (and heads), slight perspective on bodies and proper hand sketches - they're definitely gonna help make my future drawings way more fresh than the plain half-body sketches I've spent the most time making, up until now.

This is probably as much character variety as you'll ever see in a single post in this whole website - some sketches are of various Nira variants from Zutomayo MVs (the names of the MVs they come from are written in the pictures' labels), some are OCs of my own - heck, one is even V1 from *Ultrakill*.
I gotta get my hands on that game as soon as I can.

The last sketch should be dated 4th of October, if the picture dates in my phone's gallery serve me right.
