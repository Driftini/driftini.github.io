The title says it all.

For quite a while, I've had this idea of a dude just walking around with a detachable sword scabbard on his leg, with the sword itself having an integrated fancy tesla coil... and emitting plasma arcs from its blade. Yeah, definitely didn't get this idea from [one of *styropyro*'s videos](https://youtu.be/UNisqZOAaAs). There's more to this whole tesla sword concept, but I'd just be writing a huge paragraph for no reason if I were to get into more detail.

While the blade's plasma arcs are missing here, I tried putting down a rough, semi-original design for the character and using a dynamic pose at the same time.

The first objective has pretty much been a total failure: it's pretty clear from the lineart I wasn't too sure about some shapes, and the overall aesthetic isn't that original either. Raiden's look from *Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance* was probably a major inspiration without me even noticing it.

That said, I am definitely not dropping the general idea for this character and I'll definitely revisit it properly, sooner or later.
