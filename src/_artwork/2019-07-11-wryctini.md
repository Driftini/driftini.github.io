## Retrospective (2022)
Okay, now **this** is a cringy one.

Pretty bad drawing aside, this was made for a meme in [the r/ShitpostCrusaders subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/ShitpostCrusaders/).

For context, nowadays I more or less dislike everything I've posted on Reddit, plus I don't like interacting with the JJBA fanbase anymore.

The meme itself wasn't even funny to begin with, I guess I just expected some easy upvotes.
