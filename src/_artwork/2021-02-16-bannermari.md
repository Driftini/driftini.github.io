## Retrospective (2022)
I used to draw Marisa *slightly* often, as you can see. Absolutely normal. Yes.

I still love how clean this looks, drawing something that looks so smooth is not really something that happens often to me.

I made this drawing in occasion of my friend's birthday: I had zero idea what I could've bought, so I made something of my own.

She ended up liking it, I guess this wasn't too bad of a gift?
