## Retrospective (2022)
Here I was beginning to get used to Flipnote Studio 3DS again.

This sketch really reminds me of Touhou 17.5's artstyle for some reason - probably because of the rough and thicker outline on Marisa.

I remember I used to think her eyes here looked like Sonic's, but I don't really see the similarity anymore.
