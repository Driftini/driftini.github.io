Hot off the success of [Malevolent Bakery](/artwork/2024-09-19-malevolentbakery), I felt like making more JJK brainrot-fueled art was the right way to go.

This time I slouched on ambition, merely planning to redraw a couple edited panels from the manga in my own style. And, like, with vocal synths, because it's funny or something.

My original expectations for this drawing weren't to be trusted: I thought I'd breeze through drawing Gojo-Teto, and have a hard time with Toji-Kaito.

But nope!
It was completely the other way around.
For some reason, I struggled really hard to draw Teto, probably because the reference was just way too far from my style and I failed to translate it well enough.

As for Kaito, getting a male head to look decent wasn't as hard as I expected with my very rusty skills in that regard.
I made my life a little easier on top of that by not referencing the Jujutsu Kaisen manga, but the same scene from the anime adaptation, with a much cleaner style, for better or for worse.
Well, easily for the better from the point of view of someone trying to reference its scenes.

Anyway, the end result is that Kaito's face winded up looking a lot more convincing than Teto's.

Generally, this is an obvious step down from Malevolent Bakery, but I guess things just gotta have highs and lows.
And guess what comes after lows?
