## Original description
A little sketch I did last year to test a new shading technique. Doesn't look that nice with pens, but I'm sure that would work on pencil drawings.

Also, I wish you an happy 2019! Sorry if I say this late, but I guess this is better than nothing.

## Retrospective (2022)
Not terrible relatively speaking, but that head line where it's not supposed be still ruins any chance this sketch may have had.
