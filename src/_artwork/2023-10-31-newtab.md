With my 18th birthday comes a new drawing tablet: my friends gifted me an XP-Pen Artist 12.
Kind of bad timing since I'm in the middle of artblock, burnout or whatever, but this is definitely gonna spice things up soon enough.

I can't take advantage of the tablet's screen just yet, since my PC needs an extra HDMI output to plug into, well, the tablet.
I guess I'll just buy an HDMI splitter as soon as I can, those seem to go for pretty cheap.

Another idea floating in my mind is using the tablet as a second screen when I'm not drawing on it.
After all, I do remember seeing some people using vertical stands for their drawing tablets so that they could double as screens, so I guess it'd be doable?
