First drawing with my new Gaomon M10K!
I just made this to get used to a drawing tablet again, and also to recover from my almost 2-week-long art break.

Decided to break the pattern here, and use Paint instead of Krita as I used to [when I borrowed my friend's Wacom One](/blog/2022-03-15-wacomfxp1).

I like how this came out, except for the lower torso that looks pretty awful, I assume due to the lack of detail, shading and any kind of color or shape variation.
