## Retrospective (2022)
Another good Flipnote Studio drawing. This one pictures a rough concept of the playable character of a Doom mod I was working on at the time.

I have absolutely not stolen 80% of the design from Sylux, an antagonist in Metroid Prime: Hunters.

The gun is pretty much completely inspired by Unreal Tournament's Enforcer.
