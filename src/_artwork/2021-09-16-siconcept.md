title: Skill Issue MC Concept

The absolute first piece of concept art for Skill Issue's main character. Absolutely not a Mark edit. Rich of original design elements.

*Or at least, so I wish.*

Nothing really stands out here, just a generic light gray/white haired dude with a katana and a coat.

Really seems like I have a long way to go before I start coming up with good character designs...
