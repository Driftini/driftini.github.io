Does it show I'm getting ever so slightly tired of drawing the same 3 characters all the time?

I gave drawing Teto a shot because I really like her SynthV design and... damn, I really underestimated how complex the outfit would be.

I never planned this to be a full-blown high effort drawing with a background or shading or whatever, but I didn't expect to struggle so much with a simple-ish sketch either.

Then again, this *is* my first attempt at drawing her (not even a single sketch to get the design right, which is cocky at best) and on top of that, I also decided to shoot myself in the foot by trying to put in a bit of perspective and posing as well.

Regardless, I'm surprised by how well this came out and by how the drill hair wasn't as hard to draw as I expected.

Oh, also this drawing seems to have awakened the sleeper agents that would make up Teto's fanbase, as evidenced by replies I got wherever I posted it, so there's that I guess.
