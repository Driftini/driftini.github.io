I have recently finished my first run of *[Hyper Light Drifter](https://www.heartmachine.com/hyper-light-drifter)*. And let me tell you, this game is **seriously** amazing. Sadly a bit on the short side if you don't go for a completionist run, though.

I felt like putting down a quick sketch to practice foreshortening and mess around with a character design I was not used to, and this is what came out after, like, 3 minutes? This leads me to believe I'm mostly just improving on drawing speed, rather than the actual final quality of the artwork.

I will probably get around to remaking this digitally as soon as I get a few higher priority drawings finished.
