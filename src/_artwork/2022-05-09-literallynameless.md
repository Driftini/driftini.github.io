Would you look at that, I actually made up another character design!
And it's not laughably basic!
*She's still nameless, though.*

First off, the sketches.
They're sorted here from oldest to newest, and you can see a bit of an increase in detail between the first and second pictures.
I am particularly proud of the latter.

As for the third picture, I simply recycled an old idea I had for *one specific, overambitious digital drawing...*
If you've been around for a few months now, you might know what I'm talking about.

What about the character itself, though?
She's part of the nonsense Skill Issue universe or whatever I've got in my head.
Also, the knife in the first picture was kind of a placeholder for something fancier than a static pose, although she wouldn't resort to close-ranged combat.
