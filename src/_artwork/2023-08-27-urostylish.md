Seeing [Urotsuki fanart on Twitter](https://twitter.com/metyayurusu/status/1674788559503659009) made me realize just how bad I've been drawing her hair in high-effort works - which so far are... just [SHY 01](/artwork/2023-08-12-shy01).

Anyway, what I meant by that is until now I've always only "ported" Uro's hair straight from her sprites in Yume 2kki, which turn out to not have much room for the details you'd expect from a drawing on a proper large canvas.

So, what am I gonna do about this?
Well, start drawing Urotsuki's hair like... hair: messy instead of being a perfectly smooth and even clump of color.

I love how this random experiment came out, I really hope I can hold this high standard for future works, at the very least future SHY posts.
Their backgrounds are starting to get to what I'd call pretty good, and I absolutely don't wanna disgrace them with poor lineart.
