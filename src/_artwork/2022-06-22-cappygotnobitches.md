Well, this wasn't the original idea, but the alternative was a drawing that would've looked like a Picrew profile picture, so I decided to take a turn and turn this into a meme.

The drawing came out with the level of quality I expected, and I'm really happy about that!
The process was pretty similar to the one I had used in [my new Aikoyori drawing](/artwork/2022-05-26-aikocool), with the special addition of highlights this time (which I've never done before!).

I guess I'm finally getting the hang of drawing again.
For once, I am actually able to make stuff during summer!
For context, every other summer I had just completely lost my ability to draw for no real reason until September came around, and finally breaking the routine really does feel great.
