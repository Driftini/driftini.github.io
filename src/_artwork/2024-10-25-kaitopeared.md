Looks like I'm finally starting to lose steam after [so](/artwork/2024-09-19-malevolentbakery) [many](/artwork/2024-10-01-bassdrop) [great](/artwork/2024-10-23-honoredone) [drawings](/artwork/2024-10-24-hpearple).

Admittedly, I didn't intend to make anything too serious this time since I wasn't gonna need this shot for [that video](https://files.catbox.moe/zf203y.mp4)'s remake, but then again I wasn't planning anything big for a couple of those past drawings either, and they still came out ridiculously well.

I don't think the problem here is the super messy lineart and coloring, but rather the very, VERY half-baked background, and the super cramped canvas which didn't allow me enough breathing room for better composition.
Well, I guess that's what happens when you skip the rough sketch and aren't blessed by enough luck to be able to wing everything without a plan.

Anyway... not much left to say, I guess?
I don't really feel as attached to this one as to the rest of my Jujutsu Kaisen brainrot art, so I don't really have too many thoughts about it besides a bit of disappointment.
