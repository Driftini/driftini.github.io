## Retrospective (2022)
**Warning: Katana ZERO spoilers ahead.**

This (unfinished) drawing is a reference to Katana ZERO's final boss fight (excluding the secret one) against Headhunter.

To start off nice and positive, Youmu's pose sucks.

As for Nitori, we once again see the Doom plasma rifle for exactly ZERO reason. Yes, I absolutely needed to make that pun. Sorry.
