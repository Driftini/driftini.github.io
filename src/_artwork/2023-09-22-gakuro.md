This started a couple days ago as a random sketch during class, but I didn't like how bad it looked (come to think of it, kinda looks like some of my early/mid-2022 art) so I decided to redraw it digitally at home.

I really like how this turned out, Uro's hand is kind of... eh, but it's the best I can do right now.
