Contrary to what you may have expected after looking at [the sketches I made over the course of September and October](/artwork/2022-09-15-seocsketches), I ended up going for a plain, shallow pose once again.

According to my friends, the background is also practically invisible on some screens - guess I'll go for better contrast, next time.
