Made this one after the explosion of the over-the-top, 3D and questionable text PNGs all over the web... or maybe just Discord and Twitter. 

Avoiding actual mentions of the text to avoid Github getting mad at me or something.

I had to pretty much trace text outlines, but other than that I guess it looks more than good enough for being a shitpost.
Also, I love blocky lighting.
