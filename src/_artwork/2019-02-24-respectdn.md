## Original description
Nope, this account isn't dead. So, after a lot of time, I've made a new drawing!

Actually, the real new thing is that this is the first digital drawing I actually put effort into, and it didn't come out that bad.

So with this said, I hope you have a nice day, bye!

## Retrospective (2022)
I am actually surprised that this looks good, maybe just sheer luck?

Anyway, I recall making this for the rules channel of some Discord server, likely mine.
