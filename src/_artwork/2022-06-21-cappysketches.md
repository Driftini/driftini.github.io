So, I had the idea of drawing [my friend Cappy Ishihara](https://twitter.com/CappyIshihara)'s OC.
These are the sketches I've made before the high-effort drawing I finished the next day.

The bottom-right sketch in the first picture (which I think came out nicely) is what I had in mind for the high-effort drawing, but I ended up changing my mind, as explained in [its own post](/artwork/2022-06-22-cappygotnobitches).

I also like the digital sketch.
Speaking of digital sketches, I am starting to really like working with a somewhat low-opacity layer for the lineart and an even lower-opacity layer for basic shading.
Actually, my [other](/artwork/2022-05-21-sidigital) [recent](/artwork/2022-05-31-amber) [digital sketches](/artwork/2022-06-01-sirelease) have been made this way.
