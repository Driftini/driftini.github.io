title: More sketches of the new guy
---
I've drawn the OC from [the last post](/artwork/2022-11-14-ahhroguehackguy) a bit more at school, I like the "camera" angle of the 1st one.
Also, I've broken *my own* rule about the visor only being opaque when the mask is on as well.
Guess I was too lazy to draw eyes on either of these sketches.
