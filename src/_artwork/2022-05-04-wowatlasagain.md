title: Quick Atlas boxhead sketch
version: 3
---

Made a very quick Atlas sketch, this time with his boxhead on.

I am happy with how unusually nice it came out, even though I barely spent over 3 minutes on it.

As usual - **Atlas belongs to atlaszoidac, make sure to [check out his own art](https://twitter.com/atlaszoidac) as well.*
