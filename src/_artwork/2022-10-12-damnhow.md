title: No idea how I made this
---
I have absolutely no idea how I made this, but I definitely love both the messy lineart and perspective on the character.

Speaking of them, I didn't even start off with a design idea in particular, and rather just kinda made up details as I went.
This is kind of a recurring theme for me, mindless drawings turning out to be better than the ones I really plan through.
