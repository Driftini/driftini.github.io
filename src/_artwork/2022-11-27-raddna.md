One of my first attempts at drawing the Nira design from [the *Only Radiant DNA* MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJy8qZ77bpE).

I think the little depth added by the lighting on this one really made a noticeable difference, the clothing looks pretty decent too.
Overall, I think it's pretty cool (+ I ended up using it as my profile picture in a bunch of places).

As an ending note, I recommend checking out the song itself, linked at the beginning of this post!
It's one of my absolute favorite tracks by Zutomayo.
