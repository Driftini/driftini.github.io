I've been thinking about making myself a "main" OC for shitposting and generally more random drawings for quite a while now. So, after a few days spent thinking about what kind of design to go for, I have settled on something fairly simple somewhat based on both the Skill Issue guy and myself.

I feel like the final design didn't turn out to be that bad, still it looks kinda generic and I think I should figure out a way to make it stand out a little more. I expect to slightly tweak his look every few sketches or so - hopefully with good results.
