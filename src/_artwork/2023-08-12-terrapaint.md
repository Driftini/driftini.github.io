title: First attempt at digital painting
version: 3

As anticipated by [*SHY 01*](/artwork/2023-08-12-shy01), I have decided to get started in digital painting, for the sake of cutting down time spent working on backgrounds of my high-effort works while still getting good-looking results.
This is - as very stealthily hinted at by the title - my first attempt at painting something loosely based off a random Terragen render I made last year.

Even though I lack any experience with this kind of art... this came out looking surprisingly great?
Not to mention it only took me 20 minutes to get a really good-looking WIP.
I frankly don't know whether to be impressed by myself or to downplay this whole work because I used a reference.

Regardless, I hope the painting journey I'm beginning right now will lead to some pretty stuff in not too long.
