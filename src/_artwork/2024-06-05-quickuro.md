title: Emulating success (and failing)
---
Naturally, after the crazy success of [my last Teto sketch](/artwork/2024-06-04-epicteto), I felt like imitating it in another drawing to see if I truly just got 10 times better overnight.
Lo and behold, I did not.

Unlike last time, I made this on Krita, just with a new brush to try and get as close as possible to the Samsung Notes pen's behavior.

I can't really tell why, but there's definitely something off here.
So let's not only imitate my last drawing, but also its post! In other words, time to throw some wild guesses.

* The face is too wide;
* The facial features aren't positioned properly;
* Blank expression;
* The back of the head could've been shifted further left;
* Everything from the neck down was rushed in a couple minutes, with little to no polishing or forethought;
* Body-head proportions might be off.

Guess I can't end this post on a positive note like last time, huh.
