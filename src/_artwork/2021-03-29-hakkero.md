## Retrospective (2022)
I believe this drawing here marks the beginning of a steep rise in quality, something you can easily notice from the thumbnails in the art archive's index.

I am still surprised that this came out so well: it really boosted my self-esteem and motivated me to draw even more.

This drawing is also the first one whose creation I've streamed on Discord in a group chat with a bunch of friends, something I still do from time to time to this day.
