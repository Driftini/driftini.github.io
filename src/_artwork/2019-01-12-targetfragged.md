## Original description
I guess Ro just defeated some opponent. Maybe it's one of Kamikazi's creatures... or maybe Protoboy or BjornBot - we'll never know, at least with this point of view only showing Robotboy.

Anyway I like how the drawing came out, and I'll soon experiment a new tecnique: drawing by hand on paper and coloring with GIMP. That would make everything quicker and it would lower the chances the drawing gets ruined because of me not being precise with the colored pencils.

The smoke doesn't look all that bad, to be honest. The feet flames are just lazy though.

Surprise surprise, I never ended up doing that.
