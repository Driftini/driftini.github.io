title: Humanoid underrated
---

One of the first of the **many** drawings of Nira's design from [Zutomayo's *Humanoid* MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAB26GgJ8V8) I'll end up making for quite a long while.

I don't think the redrawn bit on the left of her visor could've been any more noticeable.

Besides that nitpick, I'm happy with this one - especially with the hair!
I feel like it conveys pretty well its... volume?
Although, Nira's hair in the MV isn't nearly this "fluffy" looking, due to [Sakiyama (its artist)](https://twitter.com/sakiyama8ma)'s really crude artstyle.
At first, I can remember really disliking it - then it suddenly started growing on me: *her style fits both the MV's imagery (perhaps unsurprisingly?) and the song's chaotic, yet incredible instrumental track like a glove*.
