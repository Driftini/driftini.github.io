Oh hey, a new character in the art archive.

I've been thinking about drawing Renko for a couple weeks or so for a small project I may or may not do in the near future, but this is the first actually decent drawing of her I managed to pull off.
There are a couple sketches from last week as well, but they turned out... quite bad.

While last time I attempted to adapt her design directly from ZUN's art, this time I used [Mary](https://icosahedron.website/@mary)'s art as reference as it was a lot easier to follow.
Seems like that idea paid off!

I'm pretty sure I drew her cheek too low, but I was too lazy to fix that.
