Unwelcome fanart I made for [vl1](https://wetdry.world/@vl1@lethallava.land), featuring Aquiko from the [*Cute Girl Collab (Subject To Change)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFKWWJ_lXRA) otoMAD he introduced me to.

I'm not too satisfied with the face, it lacks appeal quite a lot and I think that's gotta do with how it's so tall for such a young character (Aqu is supposed to be 13).

As much as I'd like to redraw the head because of this, I think it'd just be better to put a rock over this and move onto new drawings, rather than trying to get a shitpost to look excellent.

Regardless, I find it pretty interesting how even though they're crudely drawn, many depictions of Aqu in the linked video look a lot better than my relatively polished take here.
If anything, I guess that says just how fundamental the mistakes I've made trying to depict this character are.
