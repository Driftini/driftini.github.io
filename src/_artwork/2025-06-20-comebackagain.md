Oh hey, guess I didn't completely forget how to draw after all!
I am a bit rusty, but that's nothing compared to what I had somewhat feared.

As you can see, I've now started defaulting to drawing Liar Dancer Teto as opposed to her SynthV design - probably a side-effect of drawing her so much for the Jujutsu Kasane saga.
Also, you know, way less complicated of a design.

Anyway, time to see if I'll manage to really get back on the grind and not end up on yet another months-long break.
