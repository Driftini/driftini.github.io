I've been wanting to reference [that one shot from the Ultra Trailer MV](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhg3KsDkMJM&t=129s) for a while now, and I finally got around to it.

I did shadows in kind of a weird way here, opting to not use the pencil - as usual - in MS Paint in favor of the highlighter, which I typically only use for paintings.

I think the result is fine enough, but not something I'd do again on future drawings - since I can't clip layers in Paint, all I could really do was just shade with the highlighter and then manually clean up any "color leaks" and trace the old lineart to bring it to a clean black again.

The baguette originally looked a lot less fancy and resembled Minecraft bread more than anything, so I made a revision that gives it a larger range of colors and makes it actually appetizing, even if just barely.

Oh, and I ended up picking this as my new profile picture on Fedi and Discord.
