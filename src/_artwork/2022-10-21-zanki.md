Quick doodle of Nira from [Zutomayo's new Time Left music video](), mostly brush experimentation. The background objectively sucks.

I've also made the lineart a bit thicker in some areas to simulate the kind of "dynamic" strokes you'd get out of a drawing tablet.

I strongly disliked this when I first made it, and ended up going on an art break for over a week, suspecting I was just burnt out.
[I eventually started drawing again](/artwork/2022-11-03-wowv1) when I bought a drawing tablet a couple weeks later.
Now I'm a little less disgusted by it.
