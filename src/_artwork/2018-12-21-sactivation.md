## Original description
This is the last drawing I made before joining DeviantArt. What does this mean? Right, from now on I'll upload new drawings!

Anyway - about this drawing - as you can see I messed up a bit with Ro's hands, and the body still doesn't look that right to me.
Nonetheless, it came out neat, and that's what I want.

## Retrospective (2022)
Those hands are bad. Overall, this drawing is not terrible but not close to being good either.
