Pardon the trash pun in the title.

I was bored during a school test, so I wasted some time drawing [*Study Me*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atvsg_zogxo) Nira on my bench.

I really like the dynamic feel of the pen strokes. I really dislike how I can't pull that off when I put my mind into drawing something instead of doodling brainlessly.
