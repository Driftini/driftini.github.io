Here I write this *beneath the cold and scathing rain* while waiting for the bus home to arrive. Thankfully, I can *wash away the anger* stemming from the bus being late by looking back at what I've drawn here. Okay - I swear I'm done with the quotes.

Remember that big ambitious drawing I want to make? Last week, I realized I still wasn't used enough to digital drawing on my phone, so I started thinking about a few drawings I could work on to practice various things I'd need to use to pull off that aforementioned fancy idea.

One of said practice drawings is this one! I am *very* happy with how this turned out, after just a few days spent working on it. 
Sure, Monsoon isn't 100% accurate to the reference material and shading may be (and probably is) total nonsense, but I still really like the overall drawing.

Here I've experimented a bit with somewhat quirkier brush settings to give the lineart a slightly rougher look. This is also the first digital drawing I've ever shaded, and I've also noticed I have barely used Sketchbook's feature to "predict" and smoothen drawn paths, which I used to be relying on just a week ago.

What else to say? I guess now that I've finished this, I can *die with a clear conscience...*

*Wait, have I really said I would've stopped with the quotes?*
