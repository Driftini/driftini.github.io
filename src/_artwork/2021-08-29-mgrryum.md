My overambitious projects VS what I can actually do.

Not long after finishing Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, I figured I could've tried my hand at drawing some seriously enormous scale stuff like Metal Gear Excelsus, but Flipnote Studio's canvas is *just a little too small* for something like this.

Admire my glorious background/environment drawing skills.
