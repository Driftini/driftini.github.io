## Retrospective (2022)
The initial sketch was just terrible in every way possible, but I somehow managed to bring out a surprisingly good drawing starting from it, the very next day.

I *really* like this and, to this day, I still believe it's one of the best things I've drawn with little to no (actually, here it's none at all) reference, ever.
