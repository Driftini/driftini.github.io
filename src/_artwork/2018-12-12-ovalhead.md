## Original description
This could've been a neat drawing if it wasn't for the oval head and the head line that somehow got over the ear lines. Also, don't care about that green thing on the left, it was just a sketch.

## Retrospective (2022)
No, it wouldn't have been neat even with a normal head - those hands are just awful. Same goes for the body.
