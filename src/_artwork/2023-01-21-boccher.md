This started as a plain sketch, until I started thinking it looked cool enough to add in some color as well.
Also, funny crewmate eyes.

I've also thrown in here an older Hitori doodle I made for an arrow meme, for good measure.
The background is [Tuyu's *Farewell to you and rock* MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cGQotpn8r4) (hopefully I got the name right).
