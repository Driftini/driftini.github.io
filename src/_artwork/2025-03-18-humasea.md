Wouldn't you look at that, this is the first almost-proper drawing I've made since... uh... [the 11th of December](2024-12-11-decsketches), it seems.

All things considered, this could've easily gone a lot worse, with me not having practiced in several months and whatnot, so I'm pretty happy with how this turned out.
A little less happy after noticing the nose is too high up, though.

I guess now we'll have to see whether or not I can truly get back to my drawing frequency from my old, old days of last year.

Oh and yeah, this is the [second](/artwork/2024-11-11-drillsea) drawing I made for [PinkSea](https://pinksea.art/).
