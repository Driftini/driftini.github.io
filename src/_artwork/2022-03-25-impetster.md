For whatever reason, somebody in my classroom had drawn crewmates on the blackboard at school and that inspired me to make this.

Not too bad, I guess?

My OC's right arm looks pretty off because of the near-completely random clothing dynamics.

What I *do* like for sure is the impostor's mouth.
I am not that familiar with drawing disturbing kinds of stuff, but this came out sorta nice nonetheless.
