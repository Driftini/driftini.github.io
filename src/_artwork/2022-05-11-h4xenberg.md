I started watching Breaking Bad recently (amazing show, by the way!), and I made this shitpost featuring [my friend omame](https://twitter.com/omametech)'s avatar as he appears in a wallpaper that has been made for him to be used in a project.

This is also one of the first sketches where I started using simpler, line-only eyes.
I think they look cool.
