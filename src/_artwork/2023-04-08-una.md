My friend [UNA](https://twitter.com/unanokakurega)'s OC.

So, let's see - noteworthy thing to say about this drawing... oh, right.
I posted this on Twitter and Discord without noticing I had disabled the lineart tint.
No idea how I even did that by accident, but I ended up realizing about 1-2 days after posting the drawing.

With that gone over, I feel like this is plagued by the same issue as pretty much all of my high-effort digital art: "static" lineart.
Overly cleaned up to the point of lacking much in the way of... "personality"?
I still have no idea how to put this into words, but the gist is that I prefer the messier pen strokes I get when drawing absent-mindedly.
I think the best recent example of the kinda lineart I'd love to achieve at all times is [the *Study Me* Nira doodle](/artwork/2023-03-28-obenchkyou) I made a little over a week ago.
