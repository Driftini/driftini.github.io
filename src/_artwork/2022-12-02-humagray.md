title: More Nira doodles
---
I *really* like the smear on the right one, I should probably experiment more with those.

I'm satisfied with *Humanoid* Nira on the left as well.
You can clearly see me trying to replicate there the cool, half-face-shaded effect I did on [the *Only Radiant DNA* Nira drawing](/artwork/2022-11-27-raddna).
