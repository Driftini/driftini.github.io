title: Remilia sketch
---
Wouldn't you look at that, a Driftini drawing that is *not* Jujutsu Kaisen brainrot in the year of our lord 2025!

[Just like last time](/artwork/2025-07-26-utauvsv), this was supposed to be a quick sketch (to learn Remilia's design), but I felt like playing around with colors and spent a bit longer on it than I intended to.

This is going to be (hopefully) the first of a bunch of practice sketches in preparation for a little project I wanna try out, involving redraws of A-One's Toho Eurobeat coverarts to print for a couple TEB compilations I wanna put together and burn to CD.

Getting back to this drawing, I've had some trouble with drawing Remilia's wavy hair, it's not really a style I'm used to.
But overall, considering I drew this without any pose reference, I'm quite happy with how it turned out!
