title: Motivational Sukuna
---
I was feeling down, so I sought after some words of encouragement from none other than the King of Curses himself.

Not as Sukuna-feeling as [one of my past sketches of him](/artwork/2024-12-11-decsketches), but I think this time I drew him in a more fitting way for my style... maybe?
Then again, the scale in this drawing is fairly small, so a less serious look was kinda inevitable.

All in all, I like this one!
