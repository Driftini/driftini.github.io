title: Profile picture for Fropple
---
Seems like now people like my stuff enough to request more of it - my friend [Fropple](https://lethallava.land/@1) did just that, asking me if I could draw a profile picture featuring his OC.

Contrary to what I expected, it seems like I can actually draw furry characters..?
I like how the face expression came out (the mouth in particular), same goes for the hair/fluff.

The hand, on the other... hand... is too small compared to the head, which I realized too late.

This time, I approached lineart tinting in yet another new way: I only made outlines dark, while keeping most of the "inner" lineart brighter.
I think it looks quite nice.
