Redraw of a [crusty GIF](https://files.catbox.moe/lpfrvh.gif).

I tried to paint in the lineart with separate value and color layers and by making use of blend modes, but I'm not quite sure I did it right and the colors are a bit duller than I'd have liked, especially on the butterfly.

I also made the mistake of using gray as a color while painting values, while I should've probably stuck to changing the opacity of plain black and white to get better contrast.

Oh, also the hand took me a while to get right but I'm quite happy with it.
