title: Licorice Birthday
---
Birthday art for [Licorice](https://lethallava.land/@licorice45), featuring [his OC](https://licorice45.github.io/ocs/licorice.html).

Although it's not distractingly bad, the anatomy here is... admittedly super messed up.
Namely, Licorice's left arm (where the shoulder is flat and the arm is not) and hand.

Also, I wish I had gone for a different, colder shadow color on the cake.
The reddish hue didn't work out as well as I expected.

Criticism aside, I think the motion effects on the cake, the surprise "particle effect" and exaggerated face expression do a good job at drawing attention away from the mistakes I mentioned a moment ago.
