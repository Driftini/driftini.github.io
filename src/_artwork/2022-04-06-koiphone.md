I've been wanting to make another Koishi drawing for a while, I don't think this really came out that well but... better than nothing?

To go into a little more detail - while the head looks fine to me, pretty much everything else is not that great.
To my eyes, at least.

I didn't bother actually filling the hat in black because I wanted to avoid ruining the drawing further.
