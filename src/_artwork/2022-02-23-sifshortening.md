My friend sent me some videos about foreshortening a couple days back, and here I finally began messing around with it, even if not that much here (if at all).

The left hand had a thumb as well, but it seems like I forgot about it when filling up the area around the hand. I originally wanted to draw the face as well, but I messed it up and just decided to paint the whole head black and forget about it. The coat isn't looking that great, but at the very least I got to play around with more "dynamic" shapes.
