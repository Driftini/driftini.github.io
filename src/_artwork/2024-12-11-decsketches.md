Welp, looks like I didn't manage to make any more big exciting drawings in the last month of this year after all.
But I'm really not complaining either, after such an eventful summer and autumn, art-wise.

For some reason I really like drawing Sukuna, his face markings don't take long at all to draw, and yet they add a lot of... percieved complexity, if that makes any sense?
I think the short version of that would be, I really like them.

Also, Ryoultran Sakane as she should've looked like back in [Malevolent Bakery](/artwork/2024-09-19-malevolentbakery).
I can't believe that's a sentence I just wrote.
