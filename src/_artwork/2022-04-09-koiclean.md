Now *this* is the nice and clean Koishi drawing I've been wishing for.
The initial sketch gave me really low expectations (mostly because of the torso looking really off), but after improving it, cleaning it and making the final lineart with an HB pencil I was pretty surprised myself.

Sure, this may not be a complex pose nor anything even close to that, but everything else just looks so nice and - again - clean to me.

I ended up omitting the frills near her shoulders out of fear of messing everything up, and I'm damn thankful to myself for that.
I am really, **really sure** I would've completely ruined the drawing if I tried to get them right in the final lineart.
