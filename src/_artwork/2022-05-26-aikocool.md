What started as another random digital sketch, ended up turning into my **absolute best** drawing of the past few months.

According to Ibis Paint X, I spent a little under 4 hours working on this.
And I am so damn happy with the result, much better than [the last "full" Aikoyori drawing](/artwork/2022-03-20-aikoyori) I've made a couple months ago.

While the pose and face expression are pretty flat, I feel like everything else went just as great as it could.

I find the lineart and shapes to be pretty good, but what really blows my perception of this drawing out of proportion is the coloring and shading.
Coloring alone is something that I rarely do and generally greatly improves a drawing, *but shading?*
*Proper shading?*

Pretty sure I've only ever done that... once before?
And it came out just fine here, nonetheless.

Also, I decided to draw eyes differently this time to avoid weird looking stuff when coloring the scleras white.

At any rate, this drawing singlehandedly made me consider implementing the new Featured Artwork box in the [website's homepage](/).
I guess that says something about how damn much I love it.
