## Retrospective (2022)
Almost somewhat decent, **and** drawn with a mouse!

I don't think I need to say anything about those *amazing* hands the clearly visible left shoulder.

This drawing inspired me to make a real-life trollburger for biology homework at school.

I posted a speeddraw kind of video of this on the now-defunct FulpTube, an old YouTube revival. It's been sad to see that website go, it was really well made and - as far as I remember - was pretty accurate to its reference material.
