Seems like I hadn't drawn anything for like a year...?

This sounds incredibly weird, but I don't think there's anything to be done about it.

The post dates have been directly copy-pasted from my old phone's gallery, I highly doubt I managed to skip a whole year with a single naming mistake.

With that aside, let's move to the usual retrospective.

This drawing isn't really anything special, but pretty much anticipated my massive - and still ongoing - wave of Touhou fanart.
