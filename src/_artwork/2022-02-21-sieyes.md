Over the course of this month I've been tweaking my artstyle a lot, starting to experiment with different eye shapes (now with pupils), drawing ears in the roughest way possible and adding in a bunch of extra small details.

The focus of this sketch is really just the head and face expression, everything else was pretty much just added as filler, which is also why the rest of the body just sucks.

Clearly, I still can't draw katana scabbards.
