Self-explanatory title.
Like with the [January sketches post](/artwork/2023-01-18-jansketches), characters are written in each picture's label.

You may recognize that the OC appearing a few times here from the [December sketches post](/artwork/2022-12-13-decsketches).

As for my favorite sketch among these, I'm really conflicted between picking the 3rd - which is relatively clean - and 4th - with a more interesting pose but annoyingly scribbled over because I suck at managing space on paper.
