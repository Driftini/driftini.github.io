Oh man, finally got to this one. Like it or not, totally interesting lore time.

I mostly use Twitter to browse cool people's equally cool artwork, but I am extremely annoyed by how so many good artists out there can't help but post more or less (with an **enormous** gap in that "or") questionable content, or just straight up NSFW (not even marked as such).

I (not so) recently found [Atlas's account](https://twitter.com/atlaszoidac) on Twitter and have been really happy to see he practically never posts the kind of content I wouldn't want to see when checking my timeline in public.

Besides, I believe his art is really cool and he's pretty much my favorite online artist as of writing this post.

With the *very touching* and *absolutely important* backstory cleared up: on Christmas, he had made a tweet asking to make any drawing, I wanted to do something fancy, and [my friend Sieg](https://twitter.com/somehowsieg) over on Discord suggested me to draw his OC, so that's what I did! And had a blast doing, too.

I streamed the whole drawing process to my friends' group chat, getting real-time feedback and just having a ton of fun. As for the end result? I'm really glad with how it turned out, although I think the sketch looked... somewhat cleaner? Also, the left arm and pockets look sorta weird to me. Even then, I did manage to get the design pretty much right in just three tries which is pretty unusual of me.

In conclusion, I believe this drawing practically saved an otherwise extremely subpar Christmas (I've been ill and in lockdown for the entire holidays). Also, I strongly recommend following or at least checking out [Atlas's Twitter account](https://twitter.com/atlaszoidac), he makes some seriously great stuff.
