title: Splatsane Teto

My response to [Anubi's Splatsune Miku drawing](https://mastodon.social/@anubiarts/112813637965273619).
I'm really keeping [this](/artwork/2024-07-15-julysk) [daily](/artwork/2024-07-16-crackheadteto) [drawing](artwork/2024-07-17-weouttawiki) [streak](/artwork/2024-07-17-yamamentary) [going](/artwork/2024-07-18-mia), huh?

As with the past few drawings, I experimented with a few things here too, namely shading lineart.
It was... probably not worth the time.
Sure, it definitely made a difference, but I think I could've safely skipped it without big repercussions on this drawing's quality.

The Yamcha pose took me some time to get right, I'm satisfied enough with what I ended up with but there's tons of room for improvement.

Another thing I could've done better is the effect of Teto and the baguette being pushed deep into the ground, probably by partially covering them at the bottom, instead of just making the bottom lineart thinner (which isn't very noticeable with the stroke width I used here).

Regardless of the self-criticism, I'm happy with how this turned out.
