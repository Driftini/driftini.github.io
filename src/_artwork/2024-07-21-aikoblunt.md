title: Aiko smoking a fat blunt

Well, the title is self-explanatory.

Referencing the [original meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/2219911-doobie-ralsei) for the pose was tougher than expected, due to Mario's very different proportions.
After iterating over a few sketches, I managed to make a workable base for the proper lineart.

After that, things were relatively smooth sailing - even the shoes came out pretty decently, something I usually struggle with!
I'd boil that down to mostly just luck though.

I could've probably done the smoke better, the striped shadow thing isn't all that great.
