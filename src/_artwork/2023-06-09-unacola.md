After [revisiting some old drawings](/artwork/09-06-2023-redraws), I still wasn't that tired so I redrew [that TF2 Scout meme](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fsc6212z2fiw41.png%3Fwidth%3D960%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D00362791cbd3b4e5b1a776866c45441181ab8fdf) with my friend [UNA](https://twitter.com/unanokakurega)'s alien OC.

While the body is definitely too wide (and the arm too close, probably), I like how this turned out.
Still, some extra shading would've been nice of me.
