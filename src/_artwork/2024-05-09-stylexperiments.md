title: Style experiments
---
Been a while since the last non-daily art post, huh?

As you might've guessed from the ever-growing date inconsistencies in dailies and the lack of any new doodle in probably over a month, I gave up on daily doodles... for now.
Maybe.
I plan to pick them up again later in the year if I feel like it, or maybe just wait it out till next year and start again from there.

But enough about that, let's go back to the present.
Over the course of making dailies, I really grew attached to the artstyle I started consistently using since... [April](/artwork/2023-04-01-silhousketch)???
That's actually far longer than I expected.

Anyway, it got more and more evident to me that this style was holding me back from improving (while also hindering my attempts at drawing more varied face expressions).
So, I decided it was about time I let go of that style and its limitations (really starting from the second drawing here), going straight back into experimentation.
And I gotta say the results are pretty satisfying!

My lack of solid fundamentals still shows in its awful glory, but eventually I'll get those right as well.

Also, looks like my burnout is finally over!
