title: PinkSea testing doodle
---
Quick doodle to test out [PinkSea for BlueSky](https://pinksea.art).

I felt like keeping things simple for a change, but... eh, not really too satisfied with this one.
Probably has to do with either the face expression, or the hand being a bit too big, or just the overall "staticness" of the drawing.

Wow, it's really been a while since the last purely negative art post!

I do assure you I'm working on better stuff behind the scenes though, I'm just not gonna post most of it because it's intended for a bigger "project" that will need a bunch more time in the oven.

Bit of a shameless plug here, but if you want to draw on PinkSea from a mobile device, you might want to look into [my userstyle+script](https://github.com/Driftini/pinkseamobile?tab=readme-ov-file#userstylesworld--greasyfork-easiest-recommended) that makes it less of a huge pain!
