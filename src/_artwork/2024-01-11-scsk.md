We're back to school sketches, respectively of Reol in the cover art of her [*Kinjitou*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_n51EPZ-PLUAhLIMyYn_8a1i4j7ZSn1Quk) album and of Nira from Zutomayo's [*Kira Killer*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5LaKxJVeVI) music video.

I think the former is pretty decent for being a first try, but I don't really feel the same way about the Nira sketch.
