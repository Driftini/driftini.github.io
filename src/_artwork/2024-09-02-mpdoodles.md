title: MagicalDraw doodles

I've been invited to a [MagicalDraw](https://draw.kuku.lu/) session by [szk](https://labo.wovs.tk/@szk), and after a bad first sketch I'm not including in this post, I managed to cook up these two doodles.

Compared to Magma/Aggie (which I've used a handful more times) MagicalDraw was entirely new to me, and while it felt... quite clunky compared to what seems more popular on the western side of the world, it wasn't too bad and I got used to it after a while.

I don't like the Adachi doodle very much, the clothing looks off (totally not because I mostly go off my gut feeling instead of proper knowledge) and the head's angle hints at perspective that's not followed by the rest of the body.

I am happy about the Urotsuki doodle though!
It's far from inspired or original, but at the very least it looks good.

Also, I guess it's worth mentioning the other 5 or so people in the MagmaPaint session with me were incredibly skilled and were printing out great drawings in a really short time, including szk who invited me!
