Noted down a rough idea for a boss fight or something in Skill Issue. I am not even gonna say anything about the scythe anymore.

I think the poses are half decent. What I do *not* like though is how the lineart looks way too... smooth? I usually do that when I'm not really confident about the shapes of some objects - just like in this case - and I feel like it's just too big of a departure from my usual artstyle. The characters' limbs look too thick as well, making them look fat or something, at least to my eyes.
