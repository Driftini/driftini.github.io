I didn't originally mean to post this one standalone, as it's just supposed to be a shot for my remake of [this video](), but I folded after seeing [a golden excuse](https://bsky.app/profile/whoupkasanedeyteto.bsky.social/post/3lrbzigzn3c23) to post this drawing early.

I kinda failed to capture the same aura of the original "Nah, I'd win" panel, but I guess that's really not that big of a deal.
