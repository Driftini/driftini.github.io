title: Nightmare Pearto
---
Being in the middle of a crippling Teto obsession, it was only about time before I folded and drew something based on the Pearto craze right now.

This only seemed to take a little short of 3 hours, which I think is quite a decent time for something like this.

I think I could've made the face a bit less flat, the left drill also looks too wide.
But again, this didn't take overly long to make, so I'm fairly happy with this regardless of the flaws, especially considering I'm not really used to make stuff in this style.
