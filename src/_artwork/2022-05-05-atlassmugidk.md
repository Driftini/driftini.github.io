I love how this one turned out!
I experimented with heads tilted upwards here - I have found drawing those easier than I expected, too.

All it really boils down to seems to be drawing a rhombus at the very bottom of the head, and making the head itself (and facial features) a bit... vertically squashed?
Although, I have kinda skipped that last part in this drawing, so I believe the effect wasn't really as good as it could be.

Still, as I said before, I am happy enough with this drawing to ignore that oversight (which rarely happens with any of my artwork).

You know the drill by now. **Atlas belongs to atlaszoidac, I recommend [taking a look at his Twitter account](https://twitter.com/atlaszoidac) for his own works!**
