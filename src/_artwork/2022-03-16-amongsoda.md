One of my first drawings made on a drawing tablet, [more on that here](/blog/2022-03-15-wacomfxp1).
I am incredibly happy with how this one turned out. Drawing tablets really do pull off miracles, don't they?

Alright, miracles aside - I couldn't have wished for more accuracy to the reference material, plus I have made this on my second day ever of using a drawing tablet!
I don't know, I just... expected it to take much longer to get used to.

I haven't gone overboard with reference (like I often do), and I believe that really helped making this into a nice drawing. I've also noticed how, unlike with digital drawing on my phone and 3DS, I have *not* made shapes wider than they're supposed to.

As mentioned in the drawing itself: **Atlas, depicted here, belongs to [atlaszoidac](https://twitter.com/atlaszoidac)!**

*Anyway, why do the good drawings always have to be random shitposts?*
