title: Even more messy goodness

Does it show that I really enjoy drawing with this artstyle?
I'm really struggling not to go on another monologue about [Sakiyama](https://twitter.com/sakiyama8ma)'s artstyle here, like in [three posts](/artwork/2022-10-10-humunderrated) [made before](/artwork/2022-10-11-funnyguy) [this one](/artwork/2022-10-13-messylines).

This was inspired by a few frames from the [*Humanoid* music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAB26GgJ8V8), it definitely shows most in the background.

The character's arm looks pretty off, probably either because of the shorter-than-should-be length, or because it stays unnaturally close to the body, even down to the hand.

Fine, enough criticism now: I'll just admit I love it for the most part and wish I could consistently draw like this.
