This stemmed from a running gag between me and my friend [Aikoyori](https://twitter.com/Aikoyori), after he's been repeatedly telling me to watch *Bocchi The Rock!* for several days in a row.

Let me get straight to the point: I think the drawing's lineart sucks, the sorta-successful attempt at a moody setting is what carries the whole thing for me.
I was just way too caught up in the latter to remember to put effort in the lineart.

This was probably my second attempt at making use of an *integration pass* - as people appear to call it - to make the subject feel more "connected", "grounded" to the background, rather than looking like a random picture overlaid on a random background.
