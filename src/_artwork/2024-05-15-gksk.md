title: New-artstyle Gokusaishiki sketch
---
Quick sketch of Reol from the Gokusaishiki MV, using the [new artstyle](/artwork/2024-05-09-stylexperiments) I started adopting a week or two ago.

While definitely cleaner and an overall step up from my [last sketch of the same character](/artwork/2023-12-13-gokusaisketch), I messed something up with the head shape, which kinda lacks appeal.
