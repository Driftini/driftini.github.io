Here are some-- nevermind, just two.
Uh... two sketches I've made during January.

The first sketch's character is Nira from the [*Hunch Gray* MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugpywe34_30), I've gotten really carried away with the background there.

Easily my favorite among the two, the second sketch is of Nira as she appears in [*Humanoid*'s MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAB26GgJ8V8) instead.
