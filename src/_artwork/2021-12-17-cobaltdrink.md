I was just messing around with sketches during a class at school and before I noticed it, I ended up with a full drawing *with* color.

The girl here isn't really a proper OC - like, yeah I didn't get her from other media but I am not planning to define her personality or anything.

I am not really used to color my drawings anymore, usually because I'm afraid of completely messing them up with no way back. And yes, while that is the case most of the time, I guess I got lucky with this one.

The hoodie doesn't really look great, I just find it to be really "flat". Anyway, I believe this is pretty nice overall.
