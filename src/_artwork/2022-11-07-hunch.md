title: Hunch Gray thing

Yet another Paint drawing, this time of Nira as she appears in [the *Hunch Gray* MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugpywe34_30).

I think the saturated shadows **really** improve the look of this drawing, way more than in anything I've made before.

I'm particularly fond of the clouds, the flat, imperfect style on backgrounds is pretty cool to me.
I was definitely inspired by some other artist(s?) to do this, probably [atlaszoidac](https://twitter.com/atlaszoidac).
