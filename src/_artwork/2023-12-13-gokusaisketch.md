Looks like Yama won't be the only music artist I listen to [and make drawings of](2023-07-30-yamatho) anymore.

I've alredy been listening to Reol for a long while now, but her new album [*Black Box*](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_li7Fpp1COCOJPAsPS1fOEy2XuVhrFGpA4) turned out to be addictive enough (one of its tracks especially, [*Agitate*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDhU6nWWja8)) to throw me right into a "Reol arc" not unlike the Yama one from the past few months.
I still think it's funny how I'm talking about *Black Box* while the drawing here instead has the character design from the cover art of [*Gokusaishiki*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lmF_Xs18mpvxzPv8kLNf9XYTgzF8j_x3w), Reol's first album (and another masterpiece).

Oh right, let me clarify that I'm talking about the **blue** *Gokusaishiki* cover art.
Because the album has not one, not two, but THREE different cover arts.
The blue one isn't even for a limited edition like I thought (that one appears to have the third, red cover art), I'm at a total loss regarding this... let's just get back to the drawing.

Believe it or not, I struggled a lot with imitating Reol's "absent" expression from the reference coverart, even though pretty much 90% of my sketches and then some do feature blank or neutral face expressions as well.
I obviously haven't nailed it in the end, but I blame this on sheer difference of artstyles.

I haven't been making serious attempts at digital drawing for quite some time now, so on one side I am satisfied at my job of translating the artstyle of Gokusaishiki's cover art into mine.
On the other hand, I still believe the lineart looks dull compared to my MS Paint art.
Maybe I have just grown too fond of aliased brushes?
One thing is for sure: my brush experimentation in Krita is far from over just yet.
