Another drawing referencing [Developing's pose sheet](https://wetdry.world/@Developing@misskey.io/112337024820124276).

Together with the last few drawings, this makes me feel like blank face expressions and "flat" poses have been holding back my art's quality for quite a while.

For some reason I really like shading Uro's hair, I just find the colors really nice.

Originally, her head was noticeably wider in this drawing, something I actually noticed by flipping the whole thing horizontally.
I ended up moving around a couple things until it looked right, and flipped the drawing back to the normal orientation.
This seems to be a surprisingly good practice to fix drawings when they look "off" for no apparent reason.
