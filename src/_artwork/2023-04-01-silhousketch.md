title: Silhouette shenanigans
---
The character is a new OC I've only drawn on paper so far (nope, you're not seeing those sketches).

I was having some trouble getting the pose to look right, so I decided to try a trick I probably heard somewhere: just "painting" the silhouette until it looks right, then carving out its lineart.
It... surprisingly worked pretty well?

The only issue here is that I got so caught up in my silhouette shenanigans that I didn't leave out enough time to draw anything other than my OC's head and the pose itself.
Regardless, I believe what I have done here does look pretty nice.
