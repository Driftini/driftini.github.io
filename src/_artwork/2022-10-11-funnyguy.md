title: Messing with messy lineart
---
I didn't really do this on purpose, but I ended up discovering a new artstyle that I quite like.
Too bad it kinda relies on me using a near-dead ballpoint pen.

It's somewhat inspired by [Sakiyama](https://twitter.com/sakiyama8ma)'s amazing artwork-- on second thought, that's quite the stretch.
The lineart **is** way messier than what I usually do, though.
