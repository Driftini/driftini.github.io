Back to Krita for this one!
I didn't really intend to make a cool looking drawing and my brain was just in "sketch mode", but I'm really happy with what came out.

I haven't used any head wireframes here, and just started everything with the slightly curved top border of Nira's visor.

I didn't add the visor color until the very end - heck, I didn't even plan on doing any shading until I thought the lineart was too good to just leave it in plain black and white.

If I remember correctly, the whole reason I shaded this was because when I added the gray background, the face's skin just looked terribly off... together with everything else, really.
