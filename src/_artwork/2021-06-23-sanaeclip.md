## Retrospective (2022)
I can't remember whether or not this was supposed to be a shitpost, but I am sure of one thing and that's influence from [Numenoko's](https://twitter.com/numenoko) artstyle.

I had just realized I had that frog clip in a cabinet and figured it'd be fancy.

I also have taped this to a shelf in my room for no reason whatsoever.
