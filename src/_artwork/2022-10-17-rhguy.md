title: Early new OC idea
---
One more nameless guy joins my cast of OCs, and this one is supposed to be the main character for a game as well. [Does this ring any bells?](/artwork/2021-09-16-siconcept)

More info on the game itself may or may not come in the future, I think it's still too early to set any expectations.

Random fun fact - his sword is pretty much a reskin of [this other character's](/artwork/2022-03-03-cysword), although this new character barely has anything else in common with him.
