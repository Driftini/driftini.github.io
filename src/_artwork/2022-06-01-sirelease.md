Well, here we are - I'm finally done working on Skill Issue.
It's not quite great, but I guess it works.

Quick context: I've worked on this for around a year total, as a school project.

The drawing is heavily cropped because the full arm looks absolutely awful.

**By the way, you can [get the game for yourself on GitHub](https://github.com/Driftini/skillissue/releases)!**
