Relatively simple drawing I made to celebrate reaching 100 followers on Twitter, which isn't really that big of a milestone even for a small account.

Anyway, it appears this was simple enough that I didn't need to make any sketches for it, once I had made my mind on the design & poses and [sketched them on paper](2022-03-05-ocsketches). Also an excuse to use my new OC.
