title: Teto once again
---
I somehow wasn't satisfied with this drawing immediately upon finishing it, and I only started liking it more and more from the next day onwards.

I may have not used the same style as in that [very good doodle from a while ago](/artwork/2024-06-04-epicteto), but I believe this looks quite great regardless!

This time, I have better clues as to why this looks so good.
For one, I used [Developing's pose reference sheet](https://wetdry.world/@Developing@misskey.io/112337024820124276) again.
Also, the confident smirk and direct eye contact definitely give Teto some life here.

I'm really satisfied with the clean lineart of the outfit, which looks even cleaner thanks to the limited palette.

Oh, I almost forgot to mention one big addition to my style that I'm sure is helping a lot with appeal: the head shape curving inward near the eyes.
I... don't really know what this trick is called, but I've noticed it's a recurring pattern across more skilled artists and I thought it's about time I give it a shot as well.
