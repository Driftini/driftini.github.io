Ehhh.... I'm not too happy with this one.
The sketch itself didn't really feel lively to begin with, let alone the final drawing.

The colors are pretty much random, I just wanted to use a new combination and went for dark blue with orange.
And I don't find that too appealing.

Colors and liveliness (or rather, lack thereof) aside, I believe there's one thing that this drawing does really well: show some of the most prominent details of my current artstyle.
Namely, what I affectionately refer to as "T eyes", the large rectangular brush for coloring/shading and the tiny shadow to represent noses.

And obviously, the new brush.
I guess it boils down to a rotated rectangle with hard edges.
I decided upon both details to try and make the lineart not feel as washed out as it'd be with standard, slightly blurry round brush with the scale at which I draw.
