title: A bunch of cool characters

Decided to redraw pretty much every character I've drawn since... January 2021 or so? In other words, not only recent OCs (mine and not), but also a few Touhou characters that I've drawn on more than one occurrence.

I've worked on this over the course of a few days, and that time definitely paid off great in the end: I am **very** happy with how this one came out.

Going more in detail, I believe [Fusazakura](https://twitter.com/fusazakura_)'s OC looks so much better here than in [the drawing I spent an entire night working on](/artwork/2022-03-26-fuszbday).

As far as [Atlas](https://twitter.com/atlaszoidac) goes, I got his boxhead to look cleaner than how it usually is in my drawings.
The hair and pretty much everything looks just as clean, I believe.

[Aikoyori](https://twitter.com/Aikoyori) is probably among the few I messed up in some way - I don't know, she just looks... off to me?
And I have the feeling the face expression is the main cause.

Not much to say about the Skill Issue guy, although the scythe is not exactly accurate to how it's supposed to look.

[Ceroro](https://twitter.com/ceroblitz)'s Cardiegon is another one I believe I messed up.
This time, I don't think the issue is the face expression as much as, maybe, the positioning of the head?
Unlike with Aikoyori, I honestly can't really pinpoint what went wrong here.

As for the Touhou characters, I think they all came out pretty nicely, although Marisa's head is a bit off.
