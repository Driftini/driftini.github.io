title: Yama, somehow
---
I couldn't contain my love for [Yama](https://twitter.com/douhwe)'s music anymore and finally drew her.

Don't be fooled by the color and shading - this is not a high-effort drawing, the lineart shows that very well.
Also, most heinous of digital art crimes, I used the ***Transform tool*** to ***scale*** and **ROTATE(!)** the lineart, that's why it looks somewhat blurry.
I'm absolutely deserving of a public execution now.

I kinda regret not making the warm tint on the shadows a bit stronger: they're a bit too pale, I think.

Be warned that this isn't the last you'll see of Yama from me... faaar from that.
