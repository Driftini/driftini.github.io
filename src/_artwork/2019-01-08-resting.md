## Original description
Here's the first Robotboy drawing I made in 2019! Actually, this is the second one and the first is the one I'll upload next... but it's not that important.

So we're starting this year with deactivated Ro sitting somewhere unknown... is he relaxing or being bored? He looks quite bored to me.

Remember to tell me in a comment how can I improve on drawing Ro, as any suggestion will make my upcoming fanart much better.

## Retrospective (2022)
...why have I even considered uploading this? If I had to guess, I rushed it in just 2 or 3 minutes.

Also, I have spared you the pain of looking at 2019 me unironically using emojis by getting rid of them in the section above.

I recommend you do **NOT** read the original description if you want to keep your brain cells intact.
