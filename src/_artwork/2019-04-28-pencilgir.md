## Original description
Hey there! Today is a trip to England lasting a week, more precisely somewhere around Cambridge (how detailed).

So, yesterday I decided to get back into drawing and I've made this. I usually don't do "final" drawing with a pencil, but turns out it's not too bad - actually I like how this came out!

By the way, I don't know if I'll be able to post stuff in England, but I'll do my best to draw something good.

What more to say, I hope you all have a wonderful day, bye!

## Retrospective (2022)
Last drawing I uploaded on DeviantArt, and really good I must say.

As for the England trip, it was great and I think I should really make a blog post going over some more detail about it.

Spoiler alert: I have not drawn a single thing there. I mean, the room I was in didn't have a table, so my only choice would've been drawing on the floor or the bed.
