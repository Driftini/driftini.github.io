Well, he's not the Skill Issue guy anymore.

As far as the hair is concerned, I pretty much went for a U-turn and turned it black instead of the old white.

I kept his coat, although with some changes to maintain some difference between him and the Skill Issue guy.
One of the changes being, making it way longer for no particular reason.
I just thought it would've looked cool or something.

He does retain his gun *(literal Mahouka CAD)* from the old design, though.

Of the 2 sketches here I prefer the left one, the pose looks kinda cool.
