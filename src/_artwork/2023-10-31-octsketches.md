title: October sketches
---
In spite of artblock about to show up at my doorstep again, here's a post with 8 new sketches.
Character names in picture labels, as usual.

Out of them all, my favorite here is the third-last sketch with Urotsuki... or not?
I really like the first two as well.

That said... I have to admit that I'm really feeling my sketches' quality going down - actually, I've felt that ever since the end of summer and I have no idea how the [gakuran Urotsuki drawing from last month](/artwork/2023-09-22-gakuron) came out as great as it did.

I tried making some Yama sketches too, but it really seems like I forgot how to draw her mask decently.
That, or the scale I'm working in is simply too small for those details.

Not really related to the overall post, but I listened to Yama's 3 new songs over the last couple days: *[pure colors](https://youtu.be/O4yzPf1oC6k)* is nice, the [one for the Hyundai ad(?)](https://youtu.be/yIncOcSN2aQ) is surprisingly pretty great, while the [Pok√©mon opening she featured in](https://youtu.be/Kk-uRP2XZw4)... it met my expectations pretty accurately.

My expectations were bad.
