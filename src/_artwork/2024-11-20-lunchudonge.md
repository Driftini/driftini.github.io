title: Lunch break Reisen
---
Anyone missed the Touhou art?

Just a quick Reisen doodle to pass the time during lunch break... speaking of which, I started an internship a couple weeks ago!
As you may expect, this means I'm gonna have way less free time for drawing, so do expect my art output to lower dramatically from now onwards, but hey, at the very least I have a stable income now.

Getting back to this doodle, the past few Jujutsu Kaisen drawings' influence shines through with a strong focus on hands and a general dynamic feel across the whole thing.

I'm gonna shift the blame for the washed out colors on Samsung Notes, where I drew this because I was too lazy to look for a half-decent mobile drawing app that I'd only end up using every once in a blue moon.

I wish I could've polished this a little more, but I really forgot how bad drawing on a phone felt like, even with a stylus.
It's just way too cramped for my liking, especially after getting so used to the comfort of a proper drawing tablet.
