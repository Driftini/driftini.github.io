That's right, new OC from me!
Yeah, for a new game project...
And you guessed it, development is already dead at the time of writing!

I think this is a pretty nice step up from [the last OC I've made for a game project](2022-11-14-ahhroguehackguy), or compared to any other OC I've made for that matter.
This time I didn't focus on overdetailing as much as on simple, big and easily recognizable features.

I really like the scarf's shading and flow, although it looks way "heavier" around his neck than I intended.
The design is absolutely not finished: the mask/helmet lacks sides besides the front one, and the jacket/coat is temporary.

This posts' attachments also feature the initial silhouette I started out from and a previous scrapped design.

Hopefully I'll pick up this one project again, just to not trash this character design.
And I guess to not trash the cool mechanics and stuff I had in mind.
