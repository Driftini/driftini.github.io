I have fleshed out the design in [sketches from a while ago](/artwork/2022-10-17-rhguy), this is what came out of it.

I really like the variant with both the visor and mask on in particular, I believe the visor shine to be the reason for that.

An unwritten "rule" for this character is that the visor should only be opaque then both it and the mask are on, otherwise it's just see-through.

As for the game, I'm still brewing ideas and since things are changing by the minute: it wouldn't make much sense to talk about it here already.
*Maybe that'll change in a future post.*
