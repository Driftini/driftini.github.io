New month sketches post, same old deal. Character names in picture labels.

After going unseen in my art archive for over a year, welcome back [Atlaszoidac](https://twitter.com/atlaszoidac)'s Atlas!
Just my impression, but doesn't his face expression look like one from the Mauzymice boykisser meme...?
Ok, that sounded way less stupid in my head.

Besides Atlas, another guy we've not seen for a while and has come back today is the [Roguehack/Deicide MC](/artwork/2022-11-14-ahhroguehackguy).

Today I've used a fancy marker I've randomly found at home with two different-sized tips.
Not gonna lie, this is probably the best marker I've ever used for lineart - it moves across paper really, REALLY smoothly.
