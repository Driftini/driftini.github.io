Sketches of [Aikoyori](https://twitter.com/Aikoyori)'s homonymous OC I made to get used to the latter's design, before making [a higher-effort digital drawing](/artwork/2022-03-20-aikoyori) later in the day.
Not really proud of the first one in particular.

I can't really pinpoint the reason, but I think Aiko's hair is real fun to draw. Pretty much the whole character is.
Also, I've done more foreshortening practice on sketch #3.

Overall, I think most of these came out pretty nice.
