title: Hunch Gray Nira, again
version: 3
---
I evidently hadn't had enough of drawing [*Hunch Gray*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugpywe34_30) Nira just yet.

Quick disclaimer - this isn't finished at all.
I've redrawn the whole thing on a larger canvas, but I kinda gave up on it in the middle of coloring.
The only reason I picked this earlier sketch over the newer version is because I feel like the incomplete coloring of the latter might be too distracting.
And I also believe the chunkier look of the strokes on the smaller canvas used by this sketch is cooler.

Nira herself looks fairly good, except for the shoes.
They don't look nearly as bulky as they are in the MV.

On the other hand, the background is still obviously in its rough sketch state: the more keen-eyed among you may have noticed how Nira has one too, although the opacity of that one is a little lower.

In fact, I originally wanted this to be a wallpaper (hence the attempt to redraw this on a larger canvas I mentioned earlier), since I was getting tired of using [the Gusare one I made a while back](/artwork/2022-09-29-gusareappreciation).
