title: Birthday Elmia
---
Scrolling through Fedi, I noticed today was the birthday of Dorotanu, an artist from Misskey.io that I follow, so I decided to draw something for the occasion (and ride my wave of sudden improvement).

The pose could definitely be less "static", but I tried to offset that with the flowing hair.

Also, the character's name is Elmia, she's Dorotanu's OC.
