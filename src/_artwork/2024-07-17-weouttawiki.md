Continuing the daily drawing streak with a quick 2kki shitpost.

It took me a few sketches to figure out how I wanted the paperback wiki to look like in Urotsuki's throat, but things worked out nicely enough in the end.

As you might've noticed, I used "particle effects" like [last time](/artwork/2024-07-16-crackheadteto).
Again, I believe they can add a lot of life to a drawing, for being such a small and quick addition.
