Bad news: Project 4Modes' development is halted and will stay like that for some time. Good news: I resumed development on Win103, basically a Windows93 theme with a few extras, like its own special installer (shown in the following picture) and dashboard.

I'll soon work on Win103's own page, but for now I'll just say the essential stuff. One of Win103's aims is letting the user customize the experience to their liking, so there will be various settings to fiddle around with.

By the way, a theming contest is in progress in the <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/sGMAdg5">Windows93 Discord server</a> and the reward is a $5 Visa gift card, which means I'll soon release Win103, probably during this week, in order to be able to submit it.

Win103 isn't the only Windows93 project I'm currently working on: there's another app in development called BloatFree. It'll allow you to easily get rid of the many regenerating-on-boot files Windows93 has, all while letting you choose what to delete and what to keep.
It will be operated from the Terminal and updates will be rolled out every time a new regenerating file is added to Windows93. You will be able to update BloatFree with a single command, without having to manually reinstall it.

With all this said, I can't really do much else than hope you have a wonderful day. See you in the next post!
