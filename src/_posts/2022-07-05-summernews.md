It's been quite a while since last post, so I thought it'd be nice to post a general update.

As it turns out, this summer is gonna be quite different from the past ones: I have broken out of the old habit of not drawing anything during this season.
In other words, I can benefit from 2-3 more months worth of practice this year and speed up the (already relatively fast) recent improvements I've noticed in my work.
I also feel like the quality of my recent works is starting to get pretty consistent, which brings me some extra confidence.

I am finally leaving my comfort zone comprised of mostly head shots, and venturing into full body drawings including proper backgrounds.
I think this sketch I've been working on for a couple nights now is the perfect example of that (well, it's what I was referring to after all).

I regret not having properly practiced drawing backgrounds until now, but I guess late is better than never.

Overall, I have the strong feeling that the remainder of this year and the next year are gonna be pretty wild, art-wise - I am *really* excited.

Considering the pace at which I'm improving, I am giving some thought about beginning to take commissions around this autumn, so to get more drawing ideas, bring in more variety, improve, and obviously make a little profit from something I am passionate about.

Moving onto a different topic, I wanna talk a bit about my newfound passion for j-pop.

It all started by coming across *[Electric Angel](https://youtu.be/sSYoz0JmnZo)* in an old stream on [atlaszoidac's Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/atlaszoidac), probably around January or December.
I particularly liked the song, so I looked it up on YouTube to listen to it a couple more times.

A week or so later, I get back on YouTube only to see a handful of meme videos about some "Lagtrain" thing, which I soon find out to be [a song](https://youtu.be/UnIhRpIT7nc) and give it a listen.

I do like the song and grab a bunch of [Inabakumori](https://www.youtube.com/c/inabakumori) (the artist) albums from Soulseek - I quickly start loving some tracks in particular, like the aforementioned *Lagtrain*, but also the single *[Rainy Boots](https://youtu.be/G5hScSFkib4)* and some tracks from the 2019 album *Anticyclone*, such as *[Pascal Beats](https://youtu.be/cYClxH2WY8E)* and *[Cooler Girl](https://youtu.be/ETHu8dz4f_Y)*.

So, here my expectations of Vocaloid, a genre I have never really liked (and still don't, outside of Inabakumori's music and *Electric Angel*), had already been subverted.

But the real bombshell wouldn't drop until [my friend Aikoyori](https://twitter.com/Aikoyori) began introducing me to a few j-pop artists such as [Sangatsu no Phantasia](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4lk0Ob-F3ptOQUUq8s0pzQ), [Zutomayo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcd-GOvl9DdyPVHQxy58bOw) and [Tuyu](https://www.youtube.com/c/EXSpins).

I got pretty much brainwashed immediately and got hooked to Sangatsu no Phantasia's music at first, listening to all their albums first (and falling in love with *[Bitter Sweet](https://youtu.be/O8tP2_wKSjM)* in particular), then the two recent singles *[Ivy Dance](https://youtu.be/iN0dC5_JQ4U)* and *[Shikaku Unmei](https://youtu.be/5JrlSDQreTY)* (real banger). 

As for Zutomayo, I don't remember what album I started with, but I do remember the first song I've listened coming from them was *[Neko Reset](https://youtu.be/Sfz5TpCRSiI)*. 
A few days ago, I've decided to relisten to their albums and grew quite the addiction to [Gusare from 2021](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kZnXbea4f7XrKfUq1Ibwa11JrqFa7BfJU), of which I love *[Can't Be Right](https://youtu.be/258qUAI7rck)* and *[Hunch Gray](https://youtu.be/ugpywe34_30)*, among a few other tracks.
As far as singles go, I find *[Mirror Tune](https://youtu.be/BVvvUGP0MFw)* to be really damn great, although it took me a few listens to realize how much I liked the song. 

I have listened to a couple albums of Tuyu's, plus the new single *[Would be nice if you grow up one day](https://youtu.be/cp8UEv8i0lc)*.
I do really like the latter, together with a couple songs from the their 2020 album: particularly *[Under the summer breeze](https://youtu.be/LoK17z6xDwI)*. 

I am still having trouble moving away from these last four artists as I can't really find anyone else I really like, guess I'll need some advice on that.

Unrelated to the rest, I'll also get my driving license in a few days from now and I've started thinking about going to some tech/art/whatever conventions or events on my own sometime, just to spend some time having fun while bringing along a friend or two and possibly getting to know some cool people whom I share interests with.

Well, here we are at the end of this post.
Long one, huh?
I just felt like sharing some news, but this quickly turned into massive textwall, *especially* with the j-pop section.
See you on the next post, I guess.
