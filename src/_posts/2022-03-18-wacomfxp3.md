title: Wacom One first impressions - Day 3 & 4
version: 3
---
Two for the price of one!
Yesterday I barely drew anything and was too tired to prepare the blogpost, so I decided to merge it with the 4th day's - so today's - journal entry.

*This is the third entry in my **Wacom One first impressions** journal. [You can read the first post here](/blog/2022-03-15-wacomfxp1).*

## Day 3
I started drawing later than usual, at around 8PM. I decided to bring some variety to my art by drawing [my friend Aikoyori](https://twitter.com/Aikoyori)'s OC, who I had only ever [sketched a couple times](/artwork/2022-03-19-miscaiko) that same day's morning: I thought it would've served as a nice sort of exercise to get more used to adapting characters to my own artstyle and bring even more variety in the long run.

Meanwhile, I was in a voice chat with some friends and as the topic turned into Among Us for a while, I took a break from the Aiko drawing to make a quick shitpost.

Once I was done with that one, I hopped back to the Aikoyori drawing and started working on the final lineart... only to get too tired to keep working on it less than a hour later, planning to continue work on it on the next day.

Nothing else really came out of that day, and I went to sleep sad to the thought of having almost completely wasted a day before returning my friend's Wacom One back to him.

## Day 4
This morning I woke up determined to make as much use as possible out of the drawing tablet as soon as I got back home from school, before returning it to my friend tomorrow... *much unlike yesterday*.

Plot twist, turns out he's alright with me keeping his tablet for even more time.
If this isn't what you'd call a saint, I don't know who else would be.
To not make things too unfair, I'll only extend the time until Monday, with this Sunday being the last day I get to spend with the One.

This isn't changing my plans, though: I **still** do want to spend as much of today as possible drawing stuff.

I start getting to work at around 4:20PM, although I take it all a bit too slowly and end up not really finishing anything today either.

Anyway, the first sketch I make today is supposed to be the thumbnail for this post, but I don't really finish in the end.
Being the idiot I am, I also spill some tea on my hoodie while trying to reproduce the pose I was drawing in real life and... attempting to somehow use it as reference?

Next up, I come back to the Aiko sketch from yesterday... and wipe the lineart I made until now.
Why? I want to slightly change her clothing on Aikoyori's - the actual person this time - advice, but I also end up touching up her hair and making the bangs on the side longer and more accurate to my reference pictures.

After a couple hours (it took this long mostly just because I was talking around on Discord instead of actually focusing on drawing) I finish the new lineart.
I believe erasing the old lineart wasn't so bad of an idea, since I feel like the hair came out much better in the current one.

The drawing is still not really finished, since I plan to color it and add some extra details. I'll probably do that tomorrow. Probably.

Sorry for posting this so late, but I'm pretty damn bad at time management.
Still happy with the sketches' quality and I keep forgetting I've been using a drawing tablet for less than a week.

I think the biggest difference between drawing on my phone and using the Wacom One is how... dynamic the brush strokes feel?

This is probably unrelated to pressure detection, although that one is incredibly convenient as well, especially when making rough sketches.
I feel like the massive difference in screen size and being able to see the whole drawing at once makes an **enormous** difference as well.

This post wraps up this small blog series. I could write about my 5th and 6th days with the Wacom, but they were pretty uneventful, so I just ended up deciding to omit them.
