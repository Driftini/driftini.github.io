Collectible souls have been added to Project 4Modes!

The differences are pretty simple: red is for currency, green is for health and the upcoming white/blue souls will refill part of your selected mode's special meter, if it features one. Souls also have size variations, in a scale from small (more common) to medium (also common) to big (quite rare).
