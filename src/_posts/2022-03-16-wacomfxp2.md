title: Wacom One first impressions - Day 2
version: 3
---
This morning has been a little more productive than yesterday's - I made a few quick sketches at school, just to make sure this wouldn't have been another of those annoying days where I appear to have forgotten how to draw.

When I came back home, I haven't immediately picked up the drawing tablet as planned, and have only begun making stuff around the late afternoon, just like yesterday.

To start things off nice and easy, I've made a quick sketch as kind of a warmup. Nothing too insane, yet.

Next up, I've decided to pick up again a bad sketch from yesterday night, aiming to just tweak it just enough to make it look decent.
A few minutes later, here I am, making a new sketch from scratch and slowly beginning to make this into a higher effort drawing.

It has taken me about an hour to get *very* close to finishing up the lineart, plus a little over another hour to clean things up and add a grand total of... two colors. *Considering gray as a color, that is.*

The end result is currently my most accurate Atlas sketch to [atlaszoidac](https://twitter.com/atlaszoidac)'s own artwork. I am *really* proud of this. By the way, you can [read more of my thoughts on this drawing here](/artwork/2022-03-16-amongsoda).

So far so good, huh? I can't believe this is just my second day of using a drawing tablet - guess my friends were right when they said having one can pull off miracles. I am starting to think buying a Wacom One myself would be far from a bad idea, considering the unexpectedly short amount of time I needed to get used to the one I borrowed from my friend.

I'm just so happy with this that I don't want to go to sleep and just keep drawing stuff, but I guess I *do* - sadly - need some sleep, after all. Well, I can't wait for tomorrow. See you then, with [the 3rd entry of this journal](/blog/2022-03-18-wacomfxp3)!
