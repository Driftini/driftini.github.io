This post is the first entry of somewhat of a journal, in which I'll gradually write about the issues, awesomeness and everything in-between that I'll be going through during my very first experience with a proper drawing tablet. This is all possible thanks to my friend, who lent me his Wacom One Medium for a few days - I'm unbelievably grateful to him for that!

As for my drawing program, I have decided to use [Krita](https://apps.kde.org/krita/). Why exactly? I... don't really know, honestly. I just tried it a couple times before and thought it was neat. Its really in-depth documentation and the fact it's OSS has probably played a major role in my choice as well.

Today, I haven't really drawn as much as I planned, since I spent most of the time just setting things up and getting used to both Krita and, obviously, the drawing tablet itself.

One of my biggest fears about using drawing tablet has always been: *how much time will it take me to get used to coordinating my pen strokes to what I see on-screen?*

I've heard of people who have taken a few days to adapt, but also a few who have needed over a month. And you know, I absolutely do **not** want to spend 60â‚¬ on something I'm not even guaranteed to ever get used to. Luckily enough, this concern has vanished pretty quickly. It has just taken me a few small "test" sketches and a little over an hour to get a little used to the new workflow and begin trying to make something half-decent.

By the way, I have settled on *Sketching-3_Leaky* as my main brush and *Bristles-4_Glaze* for "coloring". In quotes because the thing I've done that most resembled coloring today was just filling a small area with gray. I haven't bothered messing with more advanced brush settings, yet.

Absurdly simple, yes. Yeah, the arm and hand do indeed suck! Same goes for the hair, probably. Best part of all this? It has taken me about 15... no, 20 minutes to make, I think? I am definitely gonna need way more practice to start cutting down the time spent on basic sketches.

I do have a few nitpicks: my biggest, yet kinda insignificant one is the pretty blurry text rendering in a few elements of Krita's GUI. Sure, it's all readable, but not really that crisp. Then again, I don't think much can be done about it - maybe some quirk Qt has on Windows?

As barely-productive as this first day may have been, I can surely confirm it has lived up to my hype. I don't think I have anything else to add as for today, so stay tuned for the 2nd entry in this journal, coming tomorrow night!
