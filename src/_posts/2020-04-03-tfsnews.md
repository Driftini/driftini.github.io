I'm writing about the News page in the News page. Just great.

News have been added to the website, so that I can keep y'all updated on stuff I do a lot more easily. I don't know how to do RSS feeds or that kind of stuff, but if possible I'll give it a shot.

Hm? Why are there older articles if this page didn't exist at that time, you ask? Well, let's just say I've spent half an hour writing about things I've done days or even weeks ago and trying to make the articles sound like they've been written on the day noted in each article's footer. It's starting to get quite late, so I guess it's time to go do the thing I hate most, homework.

Tomorrow I'll write another article here, not about Doom mods or other projects, but about the whole coronavirus mess going on in pretty much the entire planet: so yeah, if you want to read what I have to say about the topic, stay tuned for the article which is, again, coming tomorrow if nothing unexpected happens.
