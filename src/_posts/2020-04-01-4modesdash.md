I have finally implemented a fully-working dash mechanic into Project 4Modes -- of course, I couldn't pair the fast pace of the melee combos with Doomguy's slow-ish speed.

Holding the run button while moving towards a direction will result in a quick dash. Obviously I can't let the player dash non-stop the whole time: there's a 2 seconds cooldown (may change in the future) between each dash so that you can't be a living bullet.

With dashes done, it's time to finish up the weapon set, then I'll start working on the Hypermode mechanics. Not gonna lie, I'm pretty hyped myself.
