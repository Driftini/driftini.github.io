Finally, the weapon set is complete.

I'll write more details when I'm done making the mod's page, but for now I can say you'll be able to use: an electric bolt gun, an incendiary shotgun, the Pyrobow, an Uzi, an automatic missile launcher and an acid launcher (shown in the following screenshot). I also reduced the dash cooldown to 1 second, since the former 2 seconds were kinda boring to wait through.

Questioning what happened to the coronavirus article I was supposed to write quite some time ago? Simple, I didn't write it yet. And I'm not even sure if I'll ever finish it. For now, I guess I can tell everyone to stay safe at home and find something to do in there. Maybe I'll write another article today, stay tuned.
