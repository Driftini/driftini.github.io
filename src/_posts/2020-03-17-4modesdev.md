title: Project 4Modes development
---
The only currently active project for now is Project 4Modes, a Doom mod I started working on a few days ago.

It'll get the most attention for now (together with this website), since apparently not working on something for a few days makes me want to completely abandon the project. Stay tuned for updates, 'cause they'll be coming pretty soon.
