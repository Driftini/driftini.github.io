  <h1>Artwork Archive</h1>
</header>

<p>
  As you may have guessed from <a href="about.html">my about page</a>, drawing is one of my main hobbies.<br>
  This page contains the vast majority of the stuff I've drawn so far.<br>
  Why? Well, it's both for myself, to see how I'm improving over the years, and for other people to have a single page
  containing all of my artwork.<br><br>

  Why not use something like DeviantArt, Pixiv and the likes? No idea, really. I guess making my own art archive is
  more fun.<br>
  Besides, I am not a massive fan of those websites' userbases, so not having to directly interact with them is an
  added bonus.<br><br>

  <b>Look out for the feedback button at the end of every post!</b><br>
  Messages saying you like what I make and any kind of constructive criticism are welcome!
