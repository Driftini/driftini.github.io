            I used to draw characters from old cartoons back in around 2018-19, then gradually started building my own artstyle
            starting from 2020 and began drawing characters from Touhou and whatnot in the same year."

            I mainly enjoy \"old\" (2015 or older) mainstream music, Nujabes tracks (I particularly love the *Luv(sic.) Hexalogy*),
            Eurobeat and amazing game soundtracks such as *Devil May Cry 5*, *Guilty Gear Strive* and *Metal Gear Rising:
            Revengenance*'s to name a few.


            Now that I've mentioned Eurobeat is among my favorite kinds of music, I'll also take advantage of the moment to say that
            some of my favorite artists from this genre are Odyssey, Manuel and ACE."

            roguelikes such as *Dead Cells* and *Risk of Rain 1 & 2* and, from time to time, open-world games like *The Legend of
            Zelda: Breath of The Wild*. I also play fancy Doom mods (**not** *Brutal Doom*) from time to time.


            I used to be an enormous *Metroid* fan as well, but with the recent somewhat dead state of the franchise, my interest
            for it has kind of died out.


            The best game I've ever played is very likely *Katana ZERO*. I **very** strongly recommend playing it, more than anything else I've mentioned before."

            about their choice of Linux distro to use, **especially** if the latter is Arch.


            With that said, I *do* admittedly dualboot Windows and Arch, but rather than bragging rights, my reason to use this
            distribution is mostly the enormous amount of packages the AUR offer. That, and to have a blank canvas to build a fancy
            setup upon.


            I also spend a lot of time on web - and recently game - development, the former of the two blending really well with my
            next interest in this list."

            a cool scenery, more likely than not I am going to take a couple pictures of it.

            The few pictures I take that I deem good enough make it to my desktop as wallpapers."
