            I used to draw characters from old cartoons back in around 2018-19, then gradually started building my own artstyle
            starting from 2020 and began drawing characters from Touhou and whatnot in the same year. Around 2022, I started
            making digital art way more often as well. Right now, I'm finding my bearings in digital painting to work on
            backgrounds for my high-effort art faster and better."

      body: "Definitely a huge part of my life as well, I listen to all kinds of stuff during most of the day.


            Timeframes for music I like weirdly change depending on the genre: for Japanese music it's nearly all 2016-17 onwards,
            for pop, rock, hip-hop and other more \"mainstream\" genres it's usually 2014-15 or older (going as far back as the 90s
            except for a couple albums). Other genres I like are Eurobeat, instrumental/ambience and some game soundtracks.


            Now, for some artists I really like roughly ordered by music genre:

            
            **Non-japanese music with lyrics**: Green Day, Jamiroquai, Cyne, Finger Eleven, Bop Alloy, Michael Jackson, Ne-Yo.


            **J-pop/j-rock/vocaloid**: Inabakumori, Zutomayo, Yama, Tsukuyomi, Yorushika, Reol, Ado. 


            **Eurobeat**: Ken Blast/Odyssey/Mortimer (...), Ace, Manuel, Leslie Parrish.


            **Ambience/instrumental**: Nujabes, Chris Christodoulou, Boards of Canada.

            roguelikes such as *Dead Cells* and *Risk of Rain 1 & 2*, but from time to time, I also play (modded) Doom and other FPSes.


            I used to be an enormous *Metroid* fan as well, but after years of near-total radio silence on the franchise in the past, my interest
            for it has kind of died out.


            All I've been playing lately though is *Yume 2kki*. Exploration and finding cool worlds there is just really addicting, not to mention
            said cool worlds tie really well with my interest in art.


            Special mention here to *Katana ZERO*. I **very** strongly recommend playing it, because of the plot that really pulled me in,
            amazing soundtrack, snappy and fun gameplay and really cool visuals."

            about their choice of Linux distro to use, **especially** if the latter is Arch.


            With that said, I *do* admittedly dualboot Windows and Arch, but rather than bragging rights, my reason to use this
            distribution is mostly the enormous amount of packages the AUR offer. That, and to have a blank canvas to build a fancy
            setup upon.


            I also spend a lot of time on web - but on and off, also on game - development, the former of the two blending really well with my
            next interest in this list."

            use of old UI design tropes like skeuomorphism, what I like to call \"1px details\", compact layouts and so on.
            
            
            Nonetheless, I'm also a big fan of a few particularly great modern themes such as KDE's Breeze and, to a lesser extent,
            Numix and Wine's new light theme."

            a pretty scenery, I am going to take a couple pictures of it, more likely than not.

            The few pictures I take that I deem good enough make it to my desktop as wallpapers."
