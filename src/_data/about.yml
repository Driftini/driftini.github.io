            I used to draw characters from old cartoons back in around 2018-19, then gradually started building my own artstyle
            starting from 2020 and began drawing characters from Touhou and whatnot in the same year. Right now I am mostly
            experimenting with different character designs, poses and perspective, while also getting more acquainted to
            digital art."

      body: "Definitely a huge part of my life as well, I listen to all kinds of stuff during most of the day.


            I mainly enjoy \"old\" (2015 or older) mainstream music and hip-hop,
            of which my favorite artists are [Nujabes](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO5XcuQe_fLJVI3sZ0LmGCA) (I particularly love his and
            Shing02's [*Luv(sic.) Hexalogy*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_ljDzjEYTId7ii1JmD_s741NUv3oiL2iGs)) and A Tribe Called Quest.

            
            I also listen to Eurobeat and amazing game soundtracks such as *Devil May Cry 5*, *Guilty Gear Strive* and *Metal Gear Rising:
            Revengenance*'s to name a few.


            Now that I've mentioned Eurobeat is among my favorite genres, I'll also take advantage of the moment to say that
            some of my favorite Eurobeat artists are [Odyssey](https://odysseymusic.bandcamp.com/), Manuel and
            [ACE](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGpmhTM8wAknIC_rncL97Pw).


            I've also recently gotten into J-Pop, which I had never thought I would've liked so much. My favorite artists in the genre
            are [Inabakumori](https://www.youtube.com/c/inabakumori), [Zutomayo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcd-GOvl9DdyPVHQxy58bOw)
            and [Sangatsu no Phantasia](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4lk0Ob-F3ptOQUUq8s0pzQ).
            

            Another genre I have discovered recently is dreampop, by listening to [Megumi Acorda](https://megumiacorda.bandcamp.com/)'s amazing album
            [*unexpectedly*](https://megumiacorda.bandcamp.com/album/unexpectedly) thanks to a friend's recommendation.
            I really recommend checking out their music, although a lot of it is not on their Bandcamp and generally pretty hard to find.

            roguelikes such as *Dead Cells* and *Risk of Rain 1 & 2*, but from time to time, I also play fancy Doom mods (**not**
            *Brutal Doom*) and some open-world games like *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild*.


            I used to be an enormous *Metroid* fan as well, but with the recent somewhat dead state of the franchise, my interest
            for it has kind of died out.


            The best game I've ever played is very likely *Katana ZERO*. I **very** strongly recommend playing it, more than anything else I've mentioned before."

      body: "If it's related in any way to technology, I probably like it. What I do not like though, is who just can't help but brag
            about their choice of Linux distro to use, **especially** if the latter is Arch.


            With that said, I *do* admittedly dualboot Windows and Arch, but rather than bragging rights, my reason to use this
            distribution is mostly the enormous amount of packages the AUR offer. That, and to have a blank canvas to build a fancy
            setup upon.


            I also spend a lot of time on web - and recently game - development, the former of the two blending really well with my
            next interest in this list."

            use of the good old skeuomorphism we were *so* used to back in the days of Windows 7 and similar.
            
            
            Nonetheless, I'm also a big fan of a few particularly great modern themes such as KDE's Breeze and, to a lesser extent,
            Numix and Wine's new light theme."

      body: "I have kinda dropped this hobby with the arrival of the COVID pandemic, but if I ever find myself outdoors and around
            a cool scenery, more likely than not I am going to take a couple pictures of it.

            The few pictures I take that I deem good enough make it to my desktop as wallpapers."
