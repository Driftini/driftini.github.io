          appendNewsItemBg("A miniature computer", `Two news articles in one day, part 2. As you can see from the background image, I have bought a Raspberry Pi 4! It didn't take <i>that</i> long to get delivered (about a week), still I can't really do much with it currently, since a micro HDMI-to-HDMI cable should've arrived from Amazon a few days ago. About that, I checked when the cable should arrive: 24th of April. C'mon Amazon, really? I expected way shorter delivery times, just like the other times... Welp, guess I can't really slap all the blame on them considering the current situation.
          <br>So, what do I plan on doing with the Pi once I get the cable? Its purpose will probably be that of a retrogaming console (I like calling the project VARM), since I'll probably install LAKKA on it. If I change my mind, I'm still not going to use Raspbian: I'll probably give Manjaro ARM a shot, probably the KDE version because of all the KDE Connect bells and whistles (no need for keyboard and mouse etc.). After all the software stuff will be done and the coronavirus will be gone, I plan on getting a 3D printed case for the whole thing, with some extra room for an internal power bank and holes for all the ports the Pi has.
          <br><br>Insert an imaginary conclusion here by yourself, because I can't come up with a good one.`, "14/04/2020", "1404202", "newsres/1404202.png");

I'll write more details when I'm done making the mod's page, but for now I can say you'll be able to use: an electric bolt gun, an incendiary shotgun, the Pyrobow, an Uzi, an automatic missile launcher and an acid launcher (shown in the background screenshot). I also reduced the dash cooldown to 1 second, since the former 2 seconds were kinda boring to wait through.
          <br><br>Questioning what happened to the coronavirus article I was supposed to write quite some time ago? Simple, I didn't write it yet. And I'm not even sure if I'll ever finish it. For now, I guess I can tell everyone to stay safe at home and find something to do in there.

          <br>News have been added to the website, so that I can keep y'all updated on everything a lot more easily. I don't know how to do RSS feeds or that kind of stuff, but if possible I'll give it a shot.
          <br>Hm? Why are there older articles if this page didn't exist at that time, you ask? Well, let's just say I've spent half an hour writing about things I've done days or even weeks ago and trying to make the articles sound like they've been written on the day noted in each article's footer. It's starting to get quite late, so I guess it's time to go do the thing I hate most, homework.
          <br><br>Tomorrow I'll write another article here, not about Doom mods or other projects, but about the whole coronavirus mess going on in pretty much the entire planet: so yeah, if you want to read what I have to say about the topic, stay tuned for the article which is, again, coming tomorrow if nothing unexpected happens.`, "03/04/2020", "030420");

Holding the run button while moving towards a direction will result in a quick dash. Obviously you can't dash non-stop for all eternity: there's a 2 seconds cooldown (may change in the future) between each dash so that you can't be a living bullet.
          <br>With dashes done, it's time to finish up the weapon set, then I'll start working on the Hypermode mechanics. Not gonna lie, I'm pretty hyped myself.`, "01/04/2020", "010420");
