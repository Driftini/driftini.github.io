          <br>News have been added to the website, so that I can keep y'all updated on everything a lot more easily. I don't know how to do RSS feeds or that kind of stuff, but if possible I'll give it a shot.
          <br>Hm? Why are there older articles if this page didn't exist at that time, you ask? Well, let's just say I've spent half an hour writing about things I've done days or even weeks ago and trying to make the articles sound like they've been written on the day noted in each article's footer. It's starting to get quite late, so I guess it's time to go do the thing I hate most, homework.
          <br><br>Tomorrow I'll write another article here, not about Doom mods or other projects, but about the whole coronavirus mess going on in pretty much the entire planet: so yeah, if you want to read what I have to say about the topic, stay tuned for the article which is, again, coming tomorrow if nothing unexpected happens.`, "03/04/2020", "030420");

Holding the run button while moving towards a direction will result in a quick dash. Obviously you can't dash non-stop for all eternity: there's a 2 seconds cooldown (may change in the future) between each dash so that you can't be a living bullet.
          <br>With dashes done, it's time to finish up the weapon set, then I'll start working on the Hypermode mechanics. Not gonna lie, I'm pretty hyped myself.`, "01/04/2020", "010420");

The differences are pretty simple: red is for currency, green is for health and the upcoming white/blue souls will refill part of your selected mode's special meter, if it features one. Souls also have size variations, in a scale from small (more common) to medium (also common) to big (quite rare).`, "27/03/2020", "270320");

Stay tuned for updates, 'cause they'll be coming pretty soon.", "17/03/2020", "1703202");
